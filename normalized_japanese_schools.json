        "Teaching approach of the school": "Working with a dedicated faculty and staff, students benefit from the school's rigorous curriculum, close-knit community, and interactions with the vibrant local culture. Students leave Nishimachi thoroughly prepared to continue their education in first-class learning institutions around the world.\nAs part of a community of learners, students are guided to take personal ownership of their learning,  to make meaningful connections with others, to pursue challenges and persevere, to act ethically and respectfully, and to use multiple processes to think, innovate and reflect. \nNishimachi leaners are empowered to know, care and take action to bring value to others and make a positive impact in their world.\nThe academic environment at Nishimachi is both rigorous and nurturing, promoting independence and resourcefulness while touting tolerance, understanding, and respect for self and others. Teachers care about the overall well-being of each child, and they strive to create an environment in which students can foster strong relationships with one another and with their teachers. As students learn how to be part of a group, developing necessary interpersonal skills in the context of the classroom, they also learn about themselves as learners.\nNishimachi’s curriculum is structured to ensure that students receive a rigorous education, relevant to their context and to their experiences in a global community.  Core subjects draw from Next Generation Science Standards, Common Core, and the AERO (American Education Reaches Out) framework.  Specialist subjects are based on American education standards including SHAPE America's National Standards for Physical Education, and the National Coalition for US Arts Standards. \n“Understanding by Design” forms the curricular framework at Nishimachi. This concept of curriculum development, assessment, and instruction is designed to foster deep understanding through stimulating, rewarding learning experiences for students. At Nishimachi, the ultimate goal of learning is student understanding and ability to communicate what they have learned. Students are at the center of the learning process at all grade levels, and they are aided by a supportive and nurturing faculty and technology tools that are used in meaningful contexts to enhance learning."

All teachers manage a page for students through our Learning Management System. We believe that being a global citizen requires knowledge and skills in the use of technology; however, the ability to function independently and act promptly in the real world also requires core knowledge and skills independent of technology.",
        "Is the school ready to use virtual classrooms when needed? (e.g. teaching lessons online if the school is closed, e.g. during COVID-19 closures)": "When school closures take place, as for during the pandemic closure in 2020, our students studied remotely, online using our school Learning Management System.

        "Approximate hours of homework given": "There are no specific expectations for K1 to K3. Expectations for Grade 1 build over the year. For Grades 2 to 5, approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour. As a guideline for the Secondary School, students can expect 10-15 minutes times the grade level of homework each night (for example, a Grade 7 student can expect (10-15 min) x 7 = 70-105 min of homework each night). \nOf course, some students finish their homework quicker and some students require more time (in particular students less proficient in English).",

        "The school supports gifted, able and talented students": "We provide a challenging, academic curriculum for all students. We believe that all of our students can perform highly and we set expectations for performance accordingly. In our Secondary School, for mathematics, our students are streamed into an extended and standard stream, with the majority of our students in the extended stream during middle school. \nAs such, our school culture is very academic and students are motivated to meet their full potential. In addition, teachers provide differentiated experiences for students and we have various club activities that promote learning. \nWe compete in various academic competitions, including MUN, Math Field Day, Brain Bowl, and the annual Waterloo Mathematics Competitions.",

While many rarely think of programming as a language, the essence of coding is exactly just that. \n​\nEngland became the first country in the world to make computer programming a mandatory subject in all grade levels in 2013.  Estonia and Finland have followed with other countries in Europe (Italy, Spain, etc.) in planning stages to make programming and coding class required for Elementary Schools.  Programming is surely critical for this generation to master. \n \nWith this information, we boast that we are the only ‘Trilingual School’ in Japan which teaches English, Japanese and Programing promoting logic, creation, expression and communication skills."

Visible Learning is a body of research that synthesizes over 1,600 meta-analyses of educational research studies to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on student learning and achievement. The Visible Learning research indicates that one of the most powerful influences on student learning is how teachers think about learning and their role within the learning process."

The style largely breaks the so-called *cycle of predictability\" as the children experience being  younger or older, more proficient or less proficient, over time, in their classes. They develop social, communication, and presentation skills as well as academic skills as an inherent part of their school experience.  Whereas one of the classroom teachers may communicate and *teach* in English and the other in Japanese, the children are welcome and encouraged to use and develop all of their language proficiencies. We view them all as emerging bilinguals or multilinguals.  This is a *translanguaging* context-based approach as opposed to a fundamentally monolingual  rule-oriented approach to language acquisition and use.  Parents are advised to check the mission on our website, as it does describe what we do, and to attend an orientation and tour as part of the application process.",
        "Teaching approach of the school": "The teachers team teach using developmental continuums  and an integrated, thematic approach, supported by the Scottish curriculum , an abundance of resources, including unlimited fieldtrip opportunities, a highly supportive administration, and extensive professional development. The school has a very low turnover of teachers and the teachers are all expected to remain for at least three years, as that is one cycle in the multiage classrooms (three age-grades) together."

Saint Maur has continuously been among the first schools in Japan, Asia, and the world to adopt and develop the Montessori system, the International Primary Curriculum (IPC), the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) program, and the International Baccalaureate (IB) program. Today, we continue to open new, state-of-the-art facilities, such as our dedicated Science Center, and introduce students to the most cutting-edge technology. We are an inclusive center that supports each member of our school community, and students receive unparalleled care in a safe, supportive, diverse, and inclusive learning environment. For 140 years, strong character and moral citizenship have been emphasized in all areas of school life at Saint Maur. We believe that our Student Behavior Profile, Essential Outcomes and Zero-Tolerance Policy towards bullying are important guiding principles throughout the development of our students. A Saint Maur student works morally and cooperatively with all people, and assumes the responsibility required to combat social injustice. We prepare students from over 35 countries to be global citizens through dynamic, international curricula. Saint Maur functions as a community that respects and values cultural and religious difference. The cultural diversity inherent in our school is one of our strengths, and students develop the knowledge, skills, and internationally-minded approach necessary to contribute productively to an increasingly interdependent global society."

It is important that the knowledge and skills students are acquiring in school are aligned with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in a growing tech-based world. To meet this objective there are various technology-based education programs implemented at TYIS:\nAll students Kindergarten to G9 have weekly computer classes to develop projects which are integrated with the mainstream curriculum. Students use Apple AirBooks to compose literary pieces, design brochures, create multimedia presentations and commercials, make podcasts, learn keyboarding skills and use digital cameras to record still images and movies.\nAccelerated Reader - The Accelerated Reader Program (AR) is a reading-based system that tracks the development of students’ reading skills. The program keeps a running record of assessment reflecting student quiz scores about books they have read. Students read at their appropriate level and take computer generated quizzes after finishing the book.\nAt the end of every trimester, students take the STAR Reading Test to determine their current reading level. The program monitors students’ answers during the test and adjusts the difficulty level of the questions. This process enhances the validity of the test results. The results are then used to select books from the library at the students’ appropriate reading level,. After reading the book, the students take a multiple choice quiz on a computer. The program offers teachers insight to the challenges and achievements of individual students. Parents are also able to follow their child’s progress and reading list through the Renaissance Place \"Home Connect\" feature. The program offers quizzes in three key areas: Reading Practice, Vocabulary Practice and Literacy Skills. Also available are quizzes for every grade based on selections from the Houghton Mifflin Reading anthologies used in the language arts curriculum. At the end of every month, students receive achievement certificates based on a point system that correlates with the books they have read and the scores achieved on quizzes.",

        "Teaching approach of the school": "At CGK, we do not decide the specific educational direction children will follow. Children's happiness can take many forms and here at CGK, we'll be close by to support them on their pathway, up until graduation. We follow a constructivist, inquiry based approach that acknowledges and respects every learner's agency in their own learning journey. We use ongoing assessment practices to determine students' abilities and interests and tailor our instruction to meet every student where they are. We do not focus only on academics, but also on character development and 21st century skills.  We believe we are all life-long learners and value continuing professional development, supporting IB workshops, postgraduate teaching degrees, in-service workshops, and professional learning communities (PLCs).\nAfter graduation, what kind of future will the children be able to create for themselves? In pursuit of a happy future, there are areas of life where simply cramming information or language education won't really help. Teachers are in a position to support children as individuals, not to impose their own values on them, but to help them think, observe, learn, and grow into independent, lifelong learners. By cultivating these abilities and mindsets, we believe they will keep challenging the future, bright-eyed and full of life, even after graduation."

        "Qualities and characteristics best defining the school": "Marist Brothers International School (MBIS) is a private, college-preparatory school, catering to students from Pre-Kindergarten to Grade 12. Since opening our doors in 1951, our graduates have consistently achieved placements in universities and colleges around the world. MBIS has been accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) since 1972, and became an IB World School in 2017. We are committed to excellence in education, but believe that excellence means more than a rigorous and stimulating curriculum. Our holistic approach includes a focused dedication to character – developing skills which make our students stand out from the crowd. Character and community are at our heart – the foundation of the Marist ‘difference’.",
        "Teaching approach of the school": "The MBIS educational philosophy and guiding statements define who we are and what we do as a school and community. They go beyond classroom teaching and learning. It is our intent for these philosophical elements to permeate through the whole school community, and, indeed, help support and guide our graduates as they leave us and join a much bigger, global community. There are three components. The Mission is a statement of belief: who we are, and what we do. The Vision is a statement of intent: a goal for improvement, and part of our culture of always looking to improve as a school and community. Finally, the Marist Expectations (MEs) are about both present and future – they are embedded in our everyday teaching and learning, and are skills and attributes that are intended to be developed over time.\nThe MEs were adopted and adapted from the International Baccalaureate Organization’s IB Learner Profile:\n“The aim of all IB programmes is to develop internationally minded people who, recognizing their common humanity and shared guardianship of the planet, help to create a better and more peaceful world… The IB learner profile represents 10 attributes valued by IB World Schools. We believe these attributes, and others like them, can help individuals and groups become responsible members of local, national and global communities” (IBO 2013).\nMBIS adopted the attributes and adapted the descriptors to suit the unique context of our school.\nThe school community periodically undertakes a review of our guiding statements. Thus, they are not necessarily intended to be set in stone, but rather a dynamic set of principles that respond to the current goals and needs of the community. During the evaluation process, all stakeholders are expected to have an opportunity to provide feedback and held shape any new direction we choose to undertake."

The curriculum thus serves to reaffirm the biblical view of the home. KCS recognizes that parents are ultimately responsible for the education of their children, therefore KCS functions in cooperation with parents."

        "Teaching approach of the school": "NIC aims to develop caring, innovative and ethical leaders with a frontier spirit who can create a peaceful and sustainable society. NIC's graduates will have the ability to bridge the gap between international cultures. \nThe case method, first developed at Harvard Business School in 1922 and now commonly used in elite academic institutions worldwide, is incorporated into the teaching approaches for leadership education at NIC. Small classes enable personalized supervision by multinational faculty members with master's or doctoral degrees and faculty from affiliated top business schools. In addition, the Summer School for prospective students (July) and a preparatory course (the Bridging Programme) for September admission are offered in the Spring term."
