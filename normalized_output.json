Early childhood education is the “beginning” of education for students. At CIS Tokyo, this is considered by teachers and parents as an opportunity to work together to provide a successful “beginning.” Curiosity is a natural characteristic in all children from birth. Fostering and enriching this instinct offers a strong foundation for learning. The kindergarten and elementary programs at CIS Tokyo are designed to ensure that the instinct to ask questions, seek more understanding, and accept the challenge is developed. The Canadian and International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programs (PYP) include specific instructional guidelines for teachers, thus ensuring that teaching practices provide inquiry-based learning for students. Thus students learn by participating with their teachers in the development of their knowledge and areas of interest. The development of curiosity results in the achievement of Canadian and PYP grade-level standards in elementary school and encourages an approach to learning that leads to Canadian and Advanced Placement high school success. Build skills and confidence Build skills and confidence CIS Personal development is an integral part of Canadian education. CIS Builds confidence by ensuring that the social-emotional well-being of students is an important goal. Interactions that occur each day among students, teachers, administrators, and parents provide examples for students about how to interact appropriately with others. Also, the CIS school guidance department provides information for all students about social and emotional development and its importance in education. These efforts by all stakeholders in the CIS educational process recognize and respond to student needs. This CIS team approach to the development of every student provides students with the skills and confidence to meet their academic goals and support their personal development. This well-developed confidence becomes the foundation for future personal growth and decision-making. Equip for the future Equip for the future From grades kindergarten to twelve,  CIS Tokyo education is designed to prepare students for post-secondary education and their future. The provision of individualized academic and personal development for students is an essential part of this process. Students are encouraged to develop communication skills and understand the importance of lifelong learning. An extensive extracurricular program also furthers the personal development of each student. International and supplementary advanced studies are blended with the Canadian curriculum to ensure that CIS students are challenged. These academic programs include the International Baccalaureate program for Kindergarten 5 to 5, CIS advanced studies in grades 6-9, and the Advanced Placement program for students in grades 10-12. Students achieve a deeper understanding of their knowledge base and how knowledge is constructed and are thus prepared for future academic and personal challenges. CIS Tokyo's students are prepared to make decisions about their future and thus achieve success in their post-secondary education and future work life.

The educational model used for preschool and kindergarten education is based on the belief that learning and playing in an enriched environment from a young age will give students opportunities to realize their potential in social, academic, and physical needs. During these years, students work with teachers who focus on the needs of students, recognizing that intelligence manifests itself in many ways and thus must be developed and fostered using many teaching strategies. English language acquisition, in particular, is encouraged in natural ways, including real-life daily experiences to which students can \"attach\" their new language skills. Through student-centered learning activities, the student in kindergarten and preschool is introduced to English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, music, art, and physical education. Learning centers, activities that encourage inquiry, direct instruction, and other teaching strategies provide the basis for each child's educational experience. The small class size gives students greater teacher contact time and the opportunity to receive individualized guidance and academic instruction.

In addition to traditional subject area teaching, learning activities are structured to provide integrated learning units. Students are encouraged to consider how subject areas are connected and how knowledge is structured. These integrated units provide opportunities for students to both excel in their areas of strength and receive support in other areas. The Canadian elementary curriculum provides teachers with a clear set of guidelines and student achievement outcomes. In the English language arts program, students are expected to achieve in speaking, listening, reading, writing, and viewing. The resources used include picture books, chapter books, and many other materials, including an introduction to the use of technology as a learning tool. From discussions about the importance of family and community in the context of social studies, the development of scientific literacy, and emphasis on mastery of mathematical rules, ideas, and principles, students develop a deepening understanding of the content topics. Music, art, and physical education programs also provide the students with opportunities to develop their strengths further. At CIS, the importance of these programs is well recognized in students' academic and personal development.

Teachers also ensure that student technology skills are developed along with the subject specific skills in each subject area. English language arts provides students with opportunities to study specific genres of literature, such as poetry, short stories, novels and essays often using technology as a learning tool. Throughout the English program speaking, listening, reading, writing, viewing, and representing skills are further developed. Students' self concept, personal expectations and intrinsic motivation are some of the most important indicators of student success at these grade levels. At CIS we ensure that student achievements are recognized, and shortcomings are identified and assisted. It is important to note that at the junior high grade level comparisons with other students will not be overstressed. Students are learning about their own strengths and are encouraged to focus on that, while recognizing areas that need to be constantly supported. Often during these years in particular students first experiment with leadership and responsibility. CIS ensures that students participate in group and extra curricular activities providing opportunities for the development of student leadership. Also students in junior high school are encouraged to further understand the connectedness of actions and consequences. Learn more .....

Core and elective high school curriculum at CIS includes courses in English language arts, mathematics, general science, biology, chemistry, physics, history, computer studies, Japanese, music, physical education and art. At CIS students will earn high school credits resulting in a Canadian academic high school graduation diploma. This academic graduation also provides students with post secondary entrance requirements for many Canadian and other universities. Significant student personal academic counseling is provided as students make these course selections and begin outlining their post secondary interests. Other opportunities at CIS include the provision of advanced placement (AP) exams, from the College Board of the United States in some grade 11 and 12 subject areas. These exams written in the spring of each academic school year can provide students with post secondary academic credits and/or placement in many North American universities. As students move through this last phase of their secondary education at CIS there is increased emphasis on the accomplishment of the skills necessary for success at the post secondary level. Teaching strategies, and student evaluation, provide a message to the students of the importance of organizational skills, emotional intelligence, and work ethic. Academic feedback and success enable students to discover their learning styles, and prepare for the challenge of the post secondary environment. Graduation Requirements Students who successfully complete Senior High School program are awarded a high school diploma from Prince Edward Island Department of Education and CIS Tokyo. In senior high grades, schools operate on a credit system. This system allows for individualization of student timetables. Each course credit consists of 110-120 hours of instructional time.

Students who go through the Primary Years Programme, or PYP, become self-motivated inquirers and internationally-minded members of their communities. Students from Kindergarten to Grade 5 learn about the world through six transdisciplinary units that are taught every year: • Who We Are • How We Express Ourselves • Where We Are in Place and Time • How We Organize Ourselves • How the World Works • Sharing the Planet Students in Pre-Kindergarten explore four transdisciplinary themes per year instead of six. These are called the “Units of Inquiry.” Each Unit of Inquiry involves open-ended exploration, gaining knowledge from different subject areas, practicing important skills, and building enduring understandings about the world. Students are typically encouraged to demonstrate their understanding through project-based work instead of paper-and-pencil tests. In the final year of elementary school, Grade 5, students demonstrate their capabilities as PYP learners during the Exhibition. This is the culminating project of the Primary Years Programme which asks students to use what they have learned throughout their elementary years as they research, explore, and take action on global issues. As they go through the PYP, students construct a worldview based on knowledge, concepts, attitudes, skills, and taking action. Knowledge At CIS, teachers follow Prince Edward Island curriculum guides. Click here if you would like more information on the subjects that are taught year to year in PEI. Concepts PYP key concepts include: form, function, causation, change, connection, perspective and responsibility. Students explore and re-explore these concepts in new contexts over the years in order to better understand our complex, changing world. Approaches to Learning (Skills) The five categories of transdisciplinary skills that PYP students practice are: thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, self-management skills, and research skills. These skills help students tackle new learning and new challenges as they grow. Action Students are encouraged in every Unit of Inquiry to take responsible action based on the understandings they have gained. They are asked to put their learning into practice to make a meaningful difference in their communities.

As graduates of our accredited Canadian secondary program they will be eligible for admittance to universities in Canada and other western countries. Successful CIS students will receive a Canadian (PEI) graduation certificate which is recognized in all provinces of Canada. The highly academic high school program provided by CIS will also ensure that successful students will achieve post secondary entrance requirements for Canadian and other universities. In addition to the regular Canadian High School program CIS is also an accredited Advanced Placement (AP) school. The AP program provides advanced university level programming to academically advanced students while they were still in high school. Most universities in Canada, the US and Japan have AP entrance policies which grant incoming students credit, placement or both for qualifying AP grades. The advantage to the AP program is that students can have more challenge in one two or more subject areas in which they have personal interest and still complete other courses are the high school level if they wish. Currently CIS Tokyo offers fully accredited AP courses in Calculus AB, English, World History, Chemistry and Physics B. CIS also offers teaching support for many other AP subjects provided the student demonstrates the aptitude. For students who qualify AP also provides for AP Scholar Awards and the AP International Diploma. Both of the above are globally recognized certificates which display exceptional achievement across several disciplines.

In building A, the library is used by our students from grade K4 and K5. Students visit the library on a weekly basis to take out and return books as well as to learn about information literacy. A favourite part of class visits to the library are read-aloud story sessions. Older students begin to develop and enhance their critical reading and research skills in preparation for their PYP exhibition at the end of grade 5. The middle school/high school library is located in building C and used by students from grades 6 to 12. The library is open twice a week after school for students to borrow and return books. Both libraries offer a range of age-appropriate materials. Throughout the year, there are opportunities for parents to purchase books. Our book fairs are always exciting events when students and parents can purchase Scholastic books. Moreover, t hrough our book club, offered by Baker Books, families can purchase books several times during the school year. We earn points for all books purchased, which we use to order additional books for the library. Two programs that the library participates in are the Sakura Medal program and the Forest of Reading program. For the Sakura Medal program, librarians from various international schools in Japan nominate recently published books in various categories. Students who read five books (four for middle school) in any category are eligible to vote for their favourite title. Votes are tallied across all participating schools, and the winning author in each category receives a Sakura Medal. For additional details, please visit the Sakura Medal website at https://sites.google.com/view/sakuramedal/home The Forest of Reading program is offered by the Ontario Library Association to highlight Canadian authors, illustrators, and publishers. Intended for readers across the country and those in Canadian international schools, the program occupies an important place in Canada’s literary scene and encourages reading among people of all ages. Further information on the program can be found at https://forestofreading.com/ At CIS Tokyo’s libraries, students can look forward to a literary adventure as together we gain an appreciation and further our love of reading!

Canada Embassy To support student curiosity about how government agencies support the people in the community, CIS students had a field trip to the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo. This event allowed for students to meet a government official who had a Q &A session after a short documentary highlighting diversity in Canada and a First Nations group in Alberta.

Admission is determined by; a) Academic and English language level relative to age, as determined by CIS entrance test and interview standards. b) Provision of outside support for the English language or academic tutoring, if deemed necessary. c) Reports from the previous school must include a recommendation regarding behaviour, education level and areas of growth. d) At least one parent must be a functional English speaker who can confidently communicate with CIS teachers in English. Canadian International School does not have a separate ESL stream. Students are placed in a regular class according to their date of birth, and a language support team works with students as needed in Grades 1 , 2 and 3. Applicants to Kindergarten will attend an informal interview with KG teachers where their level of spoken English, number, letter, colour and shape recognition, and ability to print their name will be assessed. Applicants for grades K4 and K5 typically adapt daily English quickly but may require additional support. Kindergarten applicants are not expected to be fluent speakers of English but must show a willingness to study in English. Parent support is crucial for this age group, and at least one parent must be a functional English speaker who can confidently communicate with CIS teachers in English. Children entering Elementary School (Grades 1 to 5) are expected to have a sufficient understanding of English to communicate with their teachers and classmates. They should be able to read at or close to the appropriate grade level. The Primary Years Program (PYP) is taught alongside Canadian curriculum outcomes, and students require good verbal and written communication skills. The entrance test for Grades 1 to 5 covers English and Math skills. A CIS administrator conducts a personal interview in English with the student and their parents. If necessary, language support may be available to assist students in these lower grades upon acceptance. Students applying to enter Junior High School (Grades 6 to 8) are expected to have studied English in their previous schools to a level where they can understand the teacher, contribute to class discussions, ask questions and read at grade level independently. Homework is an integral part of the curriculum, and students are expected to complete research projects and solve math word problems in their own time. Students applying to enroll in Senior High School (Grades 9 through 12) are expected to be near fluent English speakers. The senior school curriculum is demanding, and students must have a high level of spoken and written ability and the ability to comprehend the written word. Class discussions, extensive reading of media articles and various texts, and several hours of homework each day are part of the program of studies in all academic subjects; a high level of English is, therefore, necessary. To graduate from CIS, Grade 12 students must satisfy the English language requirements of the Department of Education (Prince Edward Island, Canada). There is no language support for students in grades 9 to 12. CIS admits students according to age at the cut-off date of December 31st. Exceptions may be made at the principal's discretion based on English language ability, previous school reports and parents' English language level. However, parents should expect the following guide to be followed in most cases.

We love it here - it’s such a wonderful community with a good balance of curriculum and experiences for both of our children, in middle school and elementary school. I remember when we first came for the tour at CA. I was being shown around the school, and then students from different grades said hi to me as if they already knew me. It felt open and welcoming, and now, having been here for 6 years, I still feel the same every time I am in the school - the friendliness from students to teachers. How would you describe the CA community? Well-connected with teachers, parents, and students working together - there are many opportunities and fun events for parents to connect with the community. The parents can be a part of the student’s learning through events such as parent information sessions, coffee mornings, and of course, all the fun PTA events to bring the community together. What do you like about being PTA president? I am very honored to be asked to step into this position. It really has been so fun and wonderful working with a diverse group of parents to create different events, connecting and bringing everyone together. I enjoy making it fun and easy for all the CA parents to support and be a part of our children's learning experience at school. In particular, the International Food Fair is our most looked-forward-to event of the year. We have a variety of food, cultures, entertainment, raffles, and friends; what more can we ask for? Our amazing team has been working so hard to make this event special, and I am very excited to try all the different foods (representing 28 countries this year) and the cultural entertainment. The Parade of Nations is also a lot of fun! \"CA's Strong Presence in the Community\" What is your perspective on CA as a parent? I like how CA has been adapting over time to incorporate different needs of society, and enhancing the educational program proactively. In particular, I’m impressed with CA’s STEM education and it’s one of the reasons why I chose CA for my children. CA has a strong presence in the international community in Kobe, and I also like to see members of CA, including myself, actively connecting with the local community. \"Strong Sense of Belonging\" What do you like about being a parent at CA? From the first day I joined, I received a warm welcome email from the Grade representative inviting me to a coffee morning to get to know other parents. That was just the beginning of my experience of a fantastic, inclusive school community where everyone is accepted. There is a sense of belonging here that you don't find in many other institutions. What is your perspective on CA as a parent? I chose CA because I really believe in the IB Curriculum and I wanted a school that mirrored my strength of feeling. That and the additional benefit of a multi-cultural environment with the option to study Japanese at a high level made this the perfect school for our family. How have your children changed after coming to CA? They have both grown as learners - they don't take anything as given. They question, they research, they consult, they collaborate, they advocate for themselves, all with the support of the faculty and staff.  It's been such a pleasure to see them become independent and take control of their education. In addition to academics, the extra-curricular clubs and activities have given them so many opportunities to explore what they really love. Mine are passionate about volleyball and music - I feel it's something that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. What do you like about living in Kobe, Japan? Living in Kobe has provided us with a wonderful and safe environment for my kids to grow. I felt comfortable about letting them do things on their own - traveling to and from school, going out with their friends etc. Also, Japan offers the best of all the seasons - hiking and cycling in Spring and Autumn, beaches in Summer, skiing in Winter.  It's somewhere you can find an activity for your children for every time of year. Alumni Testimonials pop up \"Global Outlook to Succeed\" How has being a CA alumnus impacted your life? Being a student at CA gave me a global outlook and the skill set to succeed anywhere in the world. I'm grateful to my friends, classmates, and educators throughout my time at CA for pushing me to grow in countless ways and expanding my horizons. \"A Place like No Other\" How does being CA alumnus impact your life? Having come to CA as a child, I had exposure to so many other perspectives and I didn’t even realize it. Learning about other cultures and other ways of looking at the world when you are young means that, when you're an adult, you value the idea that there are many different ways to look at the world - there's no ‘right way’. I'm also very thankful to have gone to CA because I met Mark here. This is our ten year anniversary, so we came to Japan to celebrate being married ten years. (Rebekah) Are there any moments from your time at CA that had a particular impact on you? My English class with Mr. Lucas was pretty impactful for me. I think he introduced a whole different way of thinking to me while I was taking Higher Level English. He could pull 15 different ideas out of a two-page short story, and we enjoyed discussing everybody’s different opinions. My time at CA was one of the most special times I'll ever have, and it's hard to describe it in finite terms - it's like an abstract feeling of being a part of the community. Everyone is sincere and cares about everyone's future. It's such a unique community, I don't think there's another place like it. (Mark) \"Emphasis on Lifelong Learning\" Why did you decide to come back to your alma mater as a staff member? As a CA graduate, I feel very fortunate to be back at CA as a member of staff. CA’s emphasis on lifelong learning and community really impacted me as a student. I felt truly inspired by my teachers, and my friends and I still talk about the memories we made in class and on school trips. CA imparted upon me the values of open-mindedness, belonging, and inclusion, which are still very important to me today - so it’s wonderful to be a part of the community again. Are there any moments from your time at CA that had a particular impact on you? The year I arrived at CA as a sixth grader stands out as a year of many firsts. I celebrated Japanese holidays in class by decorating nengajo for New Year’s and eating roasted soybeans for setsubun . I learned how to ski on the class ski trip. Even the small things, like biking to school with friends and being introduced to new music, new snacks, and new stores, was so meaningful. Suddenly I was learning so much about the world, and not through a textbook, but through the friendships I made and the experiences I was having. Student Testimonials pop up \"I Made Myself Another Home Here\" How do you feel about living in the CA Dorm? I feel that as a dorm student you can make friendships that are different from the friendships you make at school. It's a different type of connection. It’s like a family in the shape of a mini society that I feel really comfortable in. How are you supported in the Dorm? There are 8 dorm parents who all live next to us, so they are really close to us and can help us at any time. Each dorm parent goes on duties to check on us or help us out when we need help. For example, if we can't read Japanese, they will help us to read instructions or translate our mail. The dorm parents help give me comfort when I talk about my struggles and they really give good advice. \"Meaningful Connections\" How was your experience coming to CA as a new student? This is my 5th year at CA, and I remember the transition was very smooth and easy when I began. Everybody was friendly, and school trips in particular helped me connect with a lot of new friends. What do you like the most about being a CA student? I like that my teachers come from an international background - they make me confident that I can succeed. \"Full of Opportunities\" How was you experience joining CA as a new student? CA was a good choice for me. The student body is diverse and there are lots of opportunities for school events and trips. I also enjoy making friends from other international schools through sports activities - I’m excited to participate in APAC tournaments in other countries. This was my first experience of doing MYP, but I didn’t have much difficulty settling in. My teachers thoroughly explained the criteria and grading system so that I could understand them well.

From our origins on September 13, 1913, Canadian Methodist Academy (CMA) opened its doors to sixteen students in Kobe, originally serving the children of missionary parents. As CMA’s appeal broadened, our name was changed in 1917 to Canadian Academy (CA). With an expanded student population, land was purchased on Nagamine-yama and a boys’ dormitory, Gloucester House, was dedicated by the Duke of Gloucester in May of 1929. We proudly remain one of the oldest boarding schools in Asia. Over the years, we continued to grow, and by the 1980s it became clear that more space and newer facilities were needed. Saying good-bye to our home on the hill, we moved to our current campus in September of 1990. Since then, our school has continually evolved its programs and facilities to support and exceed the needs of our community. The opening of the Early Learning Activities Center (ELAC) in 2008 marked a significant milestone, providing a dedicated space for our youngest learners, along with a black-box theatre and a second gymnasium. In 2013, we proudly celebrated our centennial, reflecting on 100 years of inspiration and positive impact. Today, we remain committed to growth and change, undertaking purposeful renovations that create beautiful and functional learning spaces for our students. We can’t wait to see what comes next! 1913 - Canadian Academy Opens Canadian Methodist Academy opened in Aotani-cho, Kobe, on 13th September, 1913. Originally a school for the children of Methodist Church missionaries, we opened with 13 students and served children from grade one through high school. Our day/boarding program was one of the first in Asia, continuing to the present day. 1922 - Red & Grey Yearbook Cover Our yearbook was renamed \"Red and Grey\" and these were adopted as our school colors, joining our school motto ( Scientia Clavis Successus- Knowledge is the Key to Success) and song from 1921. 1929 - Duke of Gloucester at dedication ceremony Needing more space, land in Nagamine Heights was purchased. Gloucester House was dedicated by and named after The Duke of Gloucester at a ceremony in May of 1929. The Duke unveiled the cairn on the new school site. The cairn can now be found by the current Gloucester House, our boarding house on our current campus. 1933 - Gloucester Boarding House With the construction of Gloucester House completed in 1933, over the next 60 years thousands of memories and life-long friendships were made within its walls. 1942 - Last Graduating Class Before WWII Our last formal graduation took place in 1942. The final pre-war Red and Grey was not professionally published but mimeographed with photos stuck in place with photo corners. 1952 - Faculty Returns Post WWII Campus reopened on September 17th, 1952 with 6 teachers and 110 students. Gloucester House and the principal's residence were the only buildings left after the bombings of Kobe in 1945. Mr Herbert Norman, Class of 1922, became headmaster and was instrumental in the re-opening of CA after the war. 1966 Opening of Matsushita Gymnasium In 1966, CA's Matsushita Gymnasium was completed. Previously, all sports were practiced outdoors on the athletic field or concrete courts. Also used as an auditorium, the Class of 1966 was the first class to have its commencement ceremony in the new facility. This gymnasium still stands today on our old campus. 1972 - First Kabuki Performance Under the guidance of Mitsuko Unno, members of the Japanese culture club presented their first kabuki performance \" Tojuro No Koi .\" Our program introduced thousands to the art of kabuki. 1990 - Rokko Island Campus Having outgrown our space in Nagaminedai, our campus was located to its current location on Rokko Island. The new school and a new Gloucester House boarding facility opened in September, 1990. On transition day, all students and teachers walked from the Nagamine Heights campus to the new Rokko Island Campus. 1995 - Great Hanshin Earthquake On January 17, 1995, the Great Hanshin Earthquake struck Kobe. Canadian Academy opened its undamaged facilities for evacuees from the disaster-stricken area. Nearly 3500 people were provided shelter on our campus. We reopened by the end of January with our students returning to classes. 2008 - Early Learning Activities Center Opens Our Early Learning Activities Center opened in January, 2008. Providing purpose-built spaces for our youngest students as well as a second gymnasium and our P&G Black Box Theatre for our older students, we are able to more fully meet the growing academic and extracurricular needs of our international and multi-aged students. 2013 - Centennial Celebration In 2013, we proudly celebrated our centennial anniversary. Students, teachers, staff, alumni, and friends of CA past and present gathered on the Rokko Island campus to mark the momentous occasion. The festivities allowed our school community to reflect on a century of inspiration and achievement as we looked forward to a bright future together. 2020 - Renovation Projects begin In the summer of 2020, we began an exciting series of upgrades to ensure that our learning spaces best reflect modern instructional practices and create an optimal environment for teaching and learning at all grade levels. The summer of 2020 saw a major renovation of our library and science spaces, while the summer of 2021 brought us a renewed Atrium, Cafeteria and Gloucester House Boarding. 2023 - Elementary Renovations The renovations for our Elementary school wing were completed over the summer of 2023. The reinvigorated learning spaces reflect our dynamic and collaborative approach to learning, with bright colors, flexible seating options, wider hallways for group work, and sliding doors between classrooms. 2024 - 3rd and 4th Floor Renovations The secondary school learning spaces on the third and fourth floors were renovated over the summer of 2024. These renovations include refreshed classrooms, multi-purpose furniture, signboards and swapboards that reflect our inclusive community values, and hallway learning spaces. Also renovated at this time was our brand new tea ceremony room, providing a welcome spot for our students to relax and connect with Japanese culture.

Our youngest learners enjoy classrooms specially designed for early childhood education, flowing seamlessly from indoor to outdoor learning, gardening, and play spaces. Purposeful Design As we continue to develop our campus, we purposefully incorporate design decisions that meet the needs of our students. Our newly renovated library, atrium, cafeteria, elementary classrooms, secondary spaces, and boarding facilities reflect our dedication to providing students with the best possible environment in which to thrive. Community Values Based on our belief that the best learning takes place socially, we have purposefully centered our campus around a freshly renovated atrium, featuring a performance space, flexible learning areas, and community coffee shop. Students enjoy gathering here during and after their classes. The atrium connects upward to our stunning library, and downward to our cafeteria. Home away from Home Our boarding students enjoy their stylish dormitory facilities, where the concept of home away from home is woven both into the design of our residential life program and into the language of the architecture itself.  Girls’ and boys’ dormitories open onto central kitchens and dining areas for socialization, with carefully designed shared bedrooms achieving balance between privacy and friendship. Event Spaces There's always something exciting going on at Canadian Academy. Artists and performers have the use of two world-class theater spaces which are professionally maintained by a dedicated engineer. Athletes perfect their skills in one of our two full-size gymnasia, on one of our two sports fields, on our outdoor basketball and tennis courts, or in our well-equipped fitness center. International Inspiration Our entire community enjoys the tranquility of our tea ceremony room, the comfort of the tatami matting in our presentation spaces, and the energy of the bamboo and other plants spread across our campus. Natural light and materials have been incorporated to provide learners with stimulating environments while also visually reflecting traditional Japanese aesthetics. Our school’s Board of Trustees made a courageous choice in the late 1980s when they decided to relocate CA from its original site in Nagamine-dai to the then-nascent Rokko Island. In retrospect it is self-evident that the ample physical space afforded by the move – and the highly specialized facilities we have subsequently developed – enabled CA to flourish into the school of choice in Japan, offering outstanding learning opportunities to all learners of all ages. Now, our nine-acre campus on Rokko Island is central to our students’ lives and a cornerstone of the idyllic residential community nestled in the bay of Kobe.

To this end, we strive to ensure the safety and well-being of every child.  CA endorses the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, of which our host country, Japan, is a signatory. We rely on preventative practices to reduce risk and ensure child safeguarding and will respond effectively to situations that are harmful to our students and our school community. CA’s Child Safeguarding Policy is reviewed and shared annually. It is the goal of the Canadian Academy to maintain a school environment for all students free from abuse. All Canadian Academy employees share a collective responsibility for the safety of Canadian Academy students. No Canadian Academy employee may engage in any activity constituting abuse. All outside contractors or volunteers who act in a teaching or supervisory role with students receive Child Safeguarding training. Canadian Academy employees must report to the Head of School, Child Safeguarding Officer or division principal any suspected abuse that takes place either in or out of school.

From Rokko Island's Kobe Bay Sheraton, Kansai International Airport can be reached by bus within one hour. Please visit the Rokko Island site for information on our school's immediate environment. To learn more about the city of Kobe, visit Kobe City's home pages. Getting here by rail By train, take the JR Kobe line to JR Sumiyoshi station, or the Hanshin line to Uozaki station. Change to the Rokko Liner, and ride it to the final stop at Marine Park. Canadian Academy is a 5 minute walk east from Marine Park. Getting here by road From Osaka , take the Hanshin Highway west and exit at Uozaki. Alternatively take Wangan-sen and exit at Rokko Island Kita. From Kobe, take the Hanshin Highway east and exit at Maya. Then transfer to Harbor Highway and go through the Rokko Ohashi.

CA is subject both to the cost pressures of operating in Japan and to competitive forces across the global international school market. All tuition and fees at Canadian Academy are reviewed annually by the Board of Trustees, and families should expect a modest annual increase in view of these factors. Information for Families The most recent information for families is summarized on this page, and can be accessed in more detail using the link below. View Tuition and Fees information for families. Information for Corporations As the tuition and other fees collected are not in themselves sufficient to offset the cost of the quality programs offered to our students, we are grateful for and reliant upon the financial support of international and Japanese corporations with families enrolled at CA. Please refer to the page linked below for further information, including specific tuition schedules for eligible corporations. View more information for corporations. The information linked on this page is provided in accordance with Japan’s Act on Specified Commercial Transaction. School Fees 2024-25 Transportation Food Services Student Support Services Payment Policies Mid-year Moves School Fees 2024-25 Application Fee - ¥90,000 Registration Fee - ¥400,000 (Waived for students entering Pre-K and Kindergarten A) Building & Development Fee - ¥260,000 ‍ Tuition Fee Pre-K / Kindergarten A - ¥1,500,000 Kindergarten B - ¥2,450,000 Grades 1-5 - ¥2,450,000 Grades 6-8 - ¥2,870,000 Grades 9-11 - ¥2,940,000 Grade 12 - ¥3,050,000 Boarding Fee - ¥3,200,000 (The boarding fee above is for the 2025-26 school year. All other fees are for the 2024-25 school year.) Transportation The school offers a transportation service for students living in areas serviced by the two school buses. The school does not offer transportation to those living in other areas. The service carries an annual fee of ¥97,000 to ¥169,000 for one-way travel, or ¥176,000 to ¥319,000 for round trip travel. As demand is high and both buses carry waiting lists, priority is given to students making an annual commitment to the bus service. Food Services Students in all grade levels have the opportunity of being served lunch by the school’s food services provider, Cezar’s Kitchen. All students will be assigned a Cezar’s account during their enrollment at CA. Families are then responsible for topping up their children’s accounts throughout the year, and Cezar’s manages account balances directly without the school’s involvement. Student Support Services All students entering Grade 1 or above who are assessed by the school as requiring English as an Additional Language (EAL) services at “beginning”, “progressing”, or “intermediate” level pay an EAL service fee of ¥200,000 per year for the first three years of enrollment, and ¥100,000 per year thereafter. Any student who requires Tier 2, 3, or 4 level support on CA’s four-tier model will be required to participate in the Learning Support program. The staffing costs associated with the program are subsidized by the family in addition to the standard tuition fee. Payment Policies School fees for new families are due in full within 30 days of invoicing or before the new student’s first day at school, whichever is earlier. School fees for returning families are due in full by the July 1 preceding the start of the school year. Application fees are payable by credit card at the time of application and required for consideration of each application. All other fees are invoiced by the Finance Office and payable by bank transfer only. All fees are payable in Japanese yen, and all bank transfer, credit card, or other charges are the responsibility of the payor. Mid-year Moves The school maintains published schedules to determine the pro-rating and/or refunds of tuition for families joining or departing the school during the academic year. Refer to the schedule of fees for further details. Withdrawal from Canadian Academy requires completion of the withdrawal form, linked here.

Corporate Contribution Plan Any corporation responsible for the educational expenses of their expatriate workers may be eligible to participate in the Corporate Contribution Plan, or “CCP”, as part of a special agreement established with the Japanese National Tax Agency in 1978. Companies participating in the CCP can benefit from certain reductions in their corporate taxes, as well as avoiding the grossing up tax impact of educational expenses for employees. Students attending Canadian Academy as part of the CCP agreement generate additional income for the school and thus contribute to the richness of CA’s programs, facilities, and opportunities. Because of this, the CCP is a vitally important aspect of the school’s operating and financial model and one which the school strongly encourages all eligible corporations to fully consider. In recognition of the above, participating in the CCP is the only way for corporations to guarantee that eligible expatriate children will be accepted to CA , subject to meeting entrance criteria, as CCP corporations are able to bypass waiting lists. Fee Structure for Corporations We recognize that finding the right school for their family is one of the main concerns of expatriate workers when corporations are considering relocating personnel to Kobe and Osaka. Canadian Academy is grateful for the long-standing trust of the corporate community in Kansai and is proud to be an integral part of the infrastructure which makes the region an attractive location for existing and prospective corporations. Corporations are expected to contribute meaningfully to the life of the school and have repeatedly done so through sponsorship of facilities and scholarships, provision of world-class opportunities to students through internships and other learning activities, and participation in school governance. Those corporations whose ongoing presence in the school community has been pre-eminent both in terms of enrollment and engagement are recognized with gratitude as long-term strategic partners. The school assesses tuition and other fees for corporations with five or more employee children enrolled at Canadian Academy according to the schedule linked below.

Early Childhood Learn more Elementary Learn more Secondary Learn more CA believes that high-quality learning is a transformative and purposeful pursuit leading to the development of understandings, skills, and dispositions. It occurs in an equitable and engaging environment where intentional and authentic experiences foster agency, viewpoint diversity, and a sense of community. Our educational ethos emphasizes inquiry, reflection, and impact: Critical inquiry is an essential component of profound learning, which enables students to become active participants in their educational journey. They learn to generate meaningful questions, and produce thoughtful answers. Learning at Canadian Academy is also marked by a focus on reflection. Students are taught to reflect upon ideas and experiences to inform subsequent thinking. Ultimately, the goal of learning at Canadian Academy is to encourage students to enthusiastically engage in actions that positively impact the world. Whether through service projects, exhibitions, or collaborations beyond the classroom, students consider the impact of their actions and choices, both on their own lives and on those around them. Canadian Academy is proud to be an IB World School, and our curriculum is based on the International Baccalaureate framework. For an understanding of our school divisions, see the table below.

Our small class sizes create a sense of community and ensure a safe experience; Early Childhood assistants are always with the children including class time, lunch time, and outdoor play times. Play-based Learning Most learning in Early Childhood happens through play - when children's intellectual and learning capacity is at its highest. In all types and stages of play, children are refining what it means to create, innovate, explore, and develop as active learners. Developing Self Confidence We listen carefully to our children’s thinking, theories, and questions to guide their natural curiosity. Children move on from the Early Learning Center confident and capable, seeing the world as an exciting place to explore and make discoveries. Purpose-Built Facilities Our Early Learning Activities Center (ELAC) is a space dedicated to our youngest learners. Classrooms are linked together for collaborative learning, and each room opens onto a playground reserved just for our youngest students. The Early Learning library, music room, and art room are located close by. Curriculum The Canadian Academy Early Childhood Curriculum follows the International Baccalaureate program of study. A typical Early Childhood school day consists of reading books, writing stories, inquiring into sciences and systems, and practicing numbers. Literacy and numeracy are introduced in age-appropriate ways in our 3 and 4 year old programs, and more formally in our Kindergarten B class. Every day students will also meet either a visual art, music, Physical education, Japanese, technology teacher, or librarian who will enrich the learning for that day. Plenty of play time is built into our 3 and 4 year old schedule, as we know children of this age learn through play and social interactions. Play, alongside engaging instruction, challenges students with multiple opportunities for cognitive growth to reach a variety of learning objectives.

We value the individuality of our students, and encourage them to discover what gives them a sense of personal fulfillment.

We empower students to be partners in the learning process. Critical Thinking and Real-World Complexity In high school, all courses challenge students to think independently, identify problems, and make connections to real-world issues. Our students are actively engaged in contemporary issues, working hard to create solutions for difficult and complex problems. They are encouraged to generate meaningful questions, think critically, and create novel responses. Thoughtful Impact Our high school students are encouraged to be thoughtful about the impact they have on others and on the world. We are committed to creating a sense of belonging for our students, and students are encouraged to be compassionate and collaborative learners. Outside of class, our student-initiated clubs and activities focus on creating positive impact for our community and for others. Our students recognize themselves as active and responsible members of their communities. Curriculum Grades 9-10 Students in Grades 9 and 10 complete the final two years of the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP). Not only does the MYP provide a strong foundation for the university preparation courses in Grades 11 and 12, but its focus on conceptual and inquiry-based learning allows students to develop the skills and dispositions needed to find a sense of belonging as well as to actively engage in actions that will positively impact the world. The MYP experience culminates in Grade 10 with a student-led Personal Project. This is a fantastic opportunity for students to develop their interests and demonstrate the skills and knowledge they have learned over the course of their MYP studies. Grades 11-12 Students in Grades 11 and 12 take IB Diploma Programme (DP) courses, with three pathways to graduation: CA Diploma + International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme: The Diploma Programme is a pre-university course that leads to external examinations and is designed for high school students aged 16 to 19. The program has earned a reputation for rigorous assessment, giving IB Diploma holders access to the world's leading universities. Students who follow the IB Diploma take courses from six subjects areas: Studies in Language and Literature, Language Acquisition, Mathematics, Individuals and Societies, Sciences, and the Arts. Three of these subjects are taken at higher level (HL) and three at standard level (SL). At the core of the IB Diploma are the Extended Essay, Theory of Knowledge, and Creativity, Activity, and Service (CAS). CA Diploma + IB Courses Certificates: Our High School students also have the option to take IB courses without pursuing the full IB Diploma. Students who would like to dedicate their time to a specific area of strong interest may prefer to choose this option. This gives students the flexibility to choose individual IB courses according to their aspirations. The number, type, and level of subjects are chosen in response to an individual student’s needs. Each IB course completed will lead to an externally recognized result for that course. CA Diploma + IB Bilingual Diploma Programme: Many of our students are multilingual, and some may choose to complete the IB Bilingual DP. Students pursuing the Bilingual DP take two Language A classes (Studies in Language and Literature), rather than one Language A class and one Language B (Language Acquisition) class.

Our High School counseling team works closely with students and families to understand each student's strengths, interests and needs, knowing that one size does not fit all. When students feel physically and emotionally healthy and can create a sense of well-being, they are better prepared to learn. We work to meet the needs of our students and families in an ever changing world. Our counseling team meets with parents and college representatives to help identify all the options available to our graduates. We deliver programming aimed to help students explore strengths, interests, possibilities and challenges, specific to each grade level. We support students through this programming and through individual work. We work collaboratively with teachers, advisors, outside providers and school leaders to address the needs of our community and students. Throughout their high school years, our students have the opportunity to meet with college and university representatives through visits and college fairs. Coffees and workshops are offered throughout the year for the parents of our high school students. Advice and practical tips in regards to university selection, the admissions process, applying for grants and bursaries, as well as the mental and physical well-being of the child all prepare families for life after Canadian Academy. In university and careers planning it is so important to remember that the needs of each student are unique and ever evolving. At Canadian Academy, we are so excited to collaborate with students in their discovery and planning for their own unique pathways.

Language Development Learning a new language takes time. Language is acquired in a predictable order along a learning continuum. It takes longer to acquire academic language (5-7 years) than social language (2-5 years). Errors and over generalizations are expected during the process of language development. Opportunities to engage with the language in various contexts (social and academic) is important for language development. Supportive Environment English is learned best in a supportive and safe environment. We provide learning engagements that allow students to be successful. Errors are not viewed negatively, but as a natural process of learning a new language. At Home Emotional and physical support Promote reading Maintain home language: Research concludes that a strong foundation in the home language facilitates the learning of a new language. Encourage your child to read, write and have family conversations in their home language. Goals of EAL Support Our goal is to support our EAL students in becoming self-directed learners who can draw on tools and strategies to best learn in the context of the class. The EAL teachers support language learners in their integration into the social and academic life at school. We believe that learning language is individual and all students have different needs and rates of learning. The EAL model at CA is designed to be flexible and responsive. What does EAL look like at CA? Research concludes that students acquire language most effectively when they are involved in all learning activities in the classroom. This allows students to learn the language in context through meaningful interactions with their teachers and peers. At CA, the EAL teachers work closely with the homeroom/subject teachers in the classroom to provide differentiated instruction and learning engagements that allow students to experience success. What kinds of support are given? Students receive both implicit and explicit language instruction within the context of the classroom. Implicit- instruction is embedded in learning experiences and resources using teaching methods effective for language learners. The focus is to use English in meaningful and realistic ways. Explicit - direct teaching of language takes place through mini-lessons, one-on-one conferences and small group sessions. It is important to note that language support does not always come directly from the EAL teacher. The classroom teacher also plays a major role by setting up learning spaces and incorporating language strategies to ensure instruction and content are accessible for all learners. How do EAL teachers provide support? By planning with the grade level teams to ensure a language-rich environment, materials and teacher methods (co-teaching) Through gathering and analyzing student data to inform instruction and monitor language development By providing resources that meet the language needs Through one-on-one conferences and feedback in reading, writing, listening, and speaking Conducting small group instruction based on a common need By meeting regularly with classroom teachers and grade level teams to discuss EAL student needs EAL in the elementary and secondary schools Students require different lengths and types of support depending on their language backgrounds, experiences with English, and their grade level. Elementary Levels Students in our elementary level EAL program receive daily support with EAL teachers within the regular classroom for specific lessons. Additionally, EAL teachers attend planning meetings to support the overall learning plan. Based on individual ability and needs, EAL support could include small-group instruction, directed mini-lessons, one-on-one assistance, and/or targeted additional instruction. Secondary School Levels The EAL Program in the secondary school has two essential components. First, students requiring EAL support are placed in selected courses with a co-teaching model. This EAL specialist is involved with co-planning the lesson and supporting learning during the lesson. Some students receive additional support through small group lessons. The model of support may vary depending on the student's course choices. Students in Grades 11-12 are expected to be proficient in English in order to access the curriculum.

In keeping with our mission to inspire students to be inquisitive, reflective, and compassionately interact with the world around them, we believe in supporting the diverse needs of our learners. Students with learning diversities, and who may require additional support to get the most out of our classes and activities, will be supported through our expertly trained learning support faculty. At CA, children with mild to moderate learning needs are supported through a broad range of research-based approaches. In the classroom, our teachers use differentiated and inclusive learning strategies to support all students to achieve their personal best and share their understanding. Students recognized as needing additional support become part of our Student Services Team. Each student’s needs are unique and a program of support is developed with this diversity in mind. Elements of the program may include small group instruction, in-class support, and study skills sessions. When necessary, the Student Support Team will consult with professionals within the community such as speech and language therapists, educational psychologists, and counsellors to meet the diverse needs of our students. What does Learning Support look like? In Elementary, we offer a Learning Resources program. Learning Resource teachers collaborate with classroom teachers to develop a tailored program to meet the needs of each student. Whether through small group lessons, in-class support, or one-on-one instruction, it is a team approach to supporting development in core areas, particularly reading, writing, and math. In Secondary, the Learning Resources program is designed to serve students who need additional support to participate in the curriculum and achieve their personal best. Similar to the Elementary model, students may be part of a small group lesson, benefit from in-class support, or one-on-one guidance. The focus in Secondary is on developing study skills, information processing, and accessing subject knowledge.

Our counselors are here to support the social-emotional well-being of every student. There are multiple pressures and factors facing our students every day. Our caring counselors and teachers are here to support the needs of our students in acquiring the skills, knowledge, and attitudes needed to become effective communicators, responsible and caring world citizens, and lifelong learners. Learning social-emotional skills is a journey just like learning math or reading. Sometimes called “soft skills”, our programmes help students understand perseverance, goal-setting, understanding their own emotions, and resolve conflict. Students engage with real-world topics such as online safety and personal wellbeing, which they will carry with them into adulthood. Parents play an important role at each stage of their child’s growth. Communication between parents, teachers, and counsellors is critical to our approach. We aim to support students from all sides - school and home. Our Counselling program begins in the Early years and Elementary through whole-class, small group, and individual sessions. Classroom teachers work side-by-side with the elementary counsellor to support and nurture development. Our Counselling program in Secondary, similar to the Elementary model, includes whole-class, small group, and individual sessions. Organized in small groups, the Secondary Advisory programme is built to further develop skills and address specific challenges and needs of each age group, including cyber-bullying, online safety, conflict resolution, goal setting, and time management, students listen, share and learn from each other. In addition, Canadian Academy counselors are available to assist students in all aspects of their personal, social, and academic growth. Growing up is not always easy; an international and multicultural setting has its own challenges. Students are invited to visit with any of the counselors to confidentially share their concerns, questions, or problems.

Visual Arts In Early Childhood and Elementary , our students learn to embrace their creativity and explore the elements of art through a variety of projects. In Secondary School , students have the opportunity to continue their artistic journey. Through guided projects and artist investigations, students will refine their skills and develop more sophisticated methodology. Throughout the year, student works are displayed in our atrium during our regular Art Exhibitions. Theatre Our Secondary School theatre program teaches students to collaborate, create, and perform.

This knowledge is displayed during grade level performances. In Secondary School, students can develop their musical skills further in Choir , Band , or Orchestra classes. In these classes, students explore advanced techniques and solidify their ability to play the instrument of their choice. Be sure not to miss our bi-annual concerts!

Canadian Academy inspires students to inquire, reflect, and choose to compassionately impact the world throughout their lives. What is Service? Service is an activity that goes beyond ordinary school or family responsibilities, is performed without payment, and helps others. Service Learning is when service is an integral part of the learning and curriculum. While doing for others starts in elementary, our service program becomes more formalized in secondary school. Service at Canadian Academy is student-initiated, meaningful, and committed to providing continued support. What are the aims of Community Service at Canadian Academy? Encourage students to continually engage in activities that help others and the environment Foster responsibility as a member of the global community Embrace human diversity through Community Service and enhance understanding of perspectives of different cultures Develop open and respectful communication skills necessary for working collaboratively with others in a diverse community Reflect on what he/she learned to take for future action The Director of Service and the Director of Admissions help students with logistics and verify that the service follows CA's service philosophy. Faculty and parent support for service activities is crucial. Many of these opportunities cannot take place without adult support. Service Activities include: Animal Rescue Kansai (ARK) Annual Clothes Drive CA Service for the Arts (CASA) Support for Child Chemo House Eco Club LGBTQ+ (GSA) Group Soup Kitchen Student Body Council (SBC) Support for Shinseijuku Orphanage Unlearning Racism at CA (URCA) ... and many more!

Seasonal Celebrations Japan has a lot of unique seasonal celebrations such as mochi pounding in the New Year, bean throwing in February, and Hinamatsuri (doll festival) in March. Our students deepen their understanding of the local culture through hands-on experiences of these celebrations. Japanese books Library books are great resources to explore the Japanese culture. Our library has an extensive collection of books to help you learn about various topic related to Japan and its culture, as well as books written in Japanese. After-school clubs We are fortunate to have a lot of internal and external experts who are happy to work with our students to share their skills related to Japanese culture. For example, Ikebana (Japanese flower arrangement) lesson is offered as an elementary after-school club. Tea Ceremony We are proud of our authentic and beautiful tea room. At Canadian Academy, everybody in the school community, including students, staff members, and parents, has a chance to study tea ceremony.

Our three student houses are located on campus, just a two minute walk from the main school building. CA dormitories, set back from the road and neighboring leadership team housing, are safe and quiet - the perfect place for students to study and sleep. Communal spaces include a new dining area, where students eat breakfast and dinner, as well as shared living rooms and kitchens. < > Communal Spaces Comfortable Bedrooms Washing & Laundry Outdoor Facilities Communal Spaces Our shared living room offers a space that teenagers want and need - an area to socialize and get to know their international housemates.  Modern, comfortable furniture, TV, recessed lighting, along with large windows providing natural lighting, all add to its bright and cheery atmosphere. Breakfasts and dinners are enjoyed by students in a shared dining area located within the boarding facilities, while lunch is served in the school cafeteria. In addition to their shared dining area where students receive catered meals, each boarding apartment also includes a kitchen with a refrigerator, stove, microwave and other utensils - because we know sometimes you might want to bake a batch of cookies or share a dish from your home country with your housemates and friends. Comfortable Bedrooms Our bedrooms have been designed to house two students comfortably. Roommates are generally assigned, but requests are honored whenever possible. While we feel that sharing a room is a valuable boarding experience and encourage students to have a roommate, we understand that some have special needs and when possible, arrangements can be made for a single room. Each bedroom includes a study carrel desk that can be flipped up when not in use. With overhead lighting directed to your desk, you'll be ready to hit the books and not bother your roommate. With windows either facing our beautiful campus or overlooking the green belt, a shaded wooded area that encircles Rokko Island, the views offer a peaceful break from one's studies. A comfortable bed and storage space complete the room. Washing & Laundry An important part of our boarding program is preparing you for life after CA. Instilling responsibility, including learning how to do one's laundry, is easily done within your new home. All of our student houses include four washers and dryers. The cleaning and care of your new home is an additional responsibility - but don't worry, we'll be there to help. Our facilities are professionally cleaned each week, making sure that the spots you might have missed are taken care of. With two showers and a full bath, along with two toilets, you'll be sure to make it to school on time feeling clean and refreshed. Outdoor Facilities In addition to the student houses, two common areas provide a place for you to hang out - either with your new boarding friends, or your classmates. With a large shared room upstairs along with a garden area perfect for barbecues, there is plenty of space to socialize and get to know your new friends better. Adjacent to our dormitories is a soccer pitch, basketball court, as well as a tennis court. And of course, our school buildings and all they offer are a stone's throw away. Clean, comfortable, fun and funky - our boarding facility is waiting to be your new home.

Downtown Kobe is a nice mixture of rich tradition and urban life. Discover your favorite spot and be a local! There's always something new and exciting to see in Kobe. Explore the city and enjoy what Kobe has to offer. Kobe is a modern city that also offers a relaxing time surrounded by the ocean and mountains. We are lucky to be surrounded by so much nature. Our Rokko Island campus is bordered by public parks and beautiful walking paths. Canadian Academy, located in Kobe, Japan , is ideally located to offer access to rich culture, breathtaking nature, and exciting urban adventures. Kobe exemplifies the blend of rich tradition and innovative modernity that Japanese culture is known for. There are plenty of opportunities to explore; spend your weekends taking a local tea ceremony class or going for a night out in downtown Kobe. Nestled between the Rokko Mountain range and the ocean, hiking, surfing, and skiing are always nearby, too. You might be amazed at how first grade students in Japan can ride trains to school by themselves. Families feel safe and secure, knowing that communities take care of and look out for each other. Public transportation is convenient, clean, and modern. In many ways, it’s an easy place to live. Kobe is located within the Kansai region, surrounded by cities that are famous not only in Japan, but around the world. A 20 minute train ride to neighboring Osaka means shopping, entertainment, and dining options are seemingly endless. A one hour train ride will take you to Kyoto and Nara, cities which are known for preserving Japanese history and tradition.

The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) has been a part of the school community since 1920. Our PTA proudly helps foster community spirit and create opportunities for social and fundraising events. The PTA also facilitates dialogue regarding issues of general interest to parents, faculty, and students. Getting involved is a great way to meet other families and be a positive influence in the community. PTA meetings are open to all members of our parent/guardian community. CA families and faculty are automatically considered PTA members, and are encouraged to attend meetings. Meetings are generally held on rotating days, in the morning of each month. Please drop in and get involved! We always welcome extra hands. The PTA creates meaningful impact at Canadian Academy. Their contributions include support of our Artist in Residence program, hosting the International Food Fair and ES Fall Celebration, running the Booster Club and Parent Partner organization, financially supporting lasting gifts and the Outstanding Graduate award, and more!

As a result, it is little wonder that the school’s alums comprise an array of inspirational people and leaders in their field. See More Mahi Patki Environmental Science, University of Tokyo After achieving an outstanding four A*s in her A Level subjects: Chemistry, Physics, Biology and Maths, Mahi Patki is now majoring in Environmental Science at the prestigious University of Tokyo. This course allows her to weave together her academic passions across all three sciences. At the time of her graduation from BST, she was at first unsure about her career aspirations; however, the satisfaction she finds now in implementing solutions to both environmental and social issues looks likely to be the focus of her future career. Her contributions to life at our school represent an impressive legacy. A few years ago, along with her Senior School contemporaries Mizuki and Flora, she took part in the COBIS Global Social Leaders competition - an organisation striving for the ‘curation of socially active and creative young people’, in which participants focused on the responsible consumption of plastic to try and reduce environmentally unfriendly waste at BST. This resulted in the creation of the ‘E-cool prefects’, and this has now become a permanent position in the Senior School’s leadership team. Mahi’s team left a real legacy, including the removal of vending machines from our school and the PET bottle ban, still in place today. Building on these achievements, Mahi has tirelessly continued fighting for her beliefs, spreading awareness of urgent social and environmental issues during her time at university. For example, her steadfast work in promoting gender equality, as well as championing the worldwide recognition of women’s issues, has led to her contribution to the women’s health project ‘ Period Rediscovered ’ run by WomEmpowered International (WE Int.) Mahi brought obstetrician Dr Yosuke Matsumiya and PhD researchers from The University of Oxford onboard to add expertise to the panel. Read her story in full Waco Yokoyama Policy Analyst at Gemserv Waco Yokoyama is a policy analyst at Gemserv, working on projects surrounding low carbon energy and sustainability policy, both in the UK and the EU. She specialises in developing sustainable and policy-resilient business and engagement strategies to help guide clients in the transition to a low carbon economy. An Oxford Kobe Graduate Scholar, she completed her MSc in Environmental Change and Management at the University of Oxford. She continues to engage in discussion on the just-transition, and participated as a panel speaker for BMW and One Young World's event during COP26. Her background is in Philosophy, with an MA from the University of Dundee whereby she has been awarded with the Joan Laing English Award, the Scots Philosophical Association Award, and the Global Undergraduate Award 2018 & 19. Read her story in full Rajan Soni Assistant Economist at the Department for International Trade To win a place at the renowned London School of Economics is a remarkable feat. To get first-class honours is another thing entirely, especially with winning the exclusive LSE Prize for Outstanding Academic Achievement award. From his passion for Economics to his commitment in organising an annual football cup for leading investment banks and law firms for the benefit of the Japan Association for Refugees, he shows a wonderfully engaged character: a prized attribute that he is proud to say, ‘BST helped to cultivate’. Rajan went on from BST to attend The University of Oxford for his MSc in Economic Development, which was a natural development from his study at LSE and his particularly his experience as an Assistant Economist for the Department for International Trade, providing analysis and evaluation of large market issues. Coupled with multiple internships, an editorial post at the Guardian contributing to articles for The Observer on a range of topics, and working on climate change issues for the Energy, Environment and Agriculture team in HM Treasury, his eclectic curiosity has served him well - he’s taken every possible opportunity. Rajan achievements go beyond the academic and even the career track: his contributions to his communities are impressive, from volunteering to reviewing, from fact-checking and copywriting chapter drafts sent to Yale University Press and various newspapers. The charity football tournaments mentioned above raised a hefty ¥10,000,000 (£70,000) over two years - an impressive feat! Rajan married Aline (a fellow BST alum) this summer, and as far as we know, theirs was the first marriage to have blossomed from a BST romance. We at offer our warm congratulations, and wish the couple the very best of luck in their years to come.

With a robust heritage and history, the school provides students, families, and the community with an exceptional educational experience. From BST’s inception in 1989 to the present, it has inspired its students to succeed academically and socially, develop talents and passions, and make choices based on shared values. Principal's message In 1919, just after the first world war, renowned physicist, Max Planck who had won a Nobel Prize, was doing a lecture tour of Germany on the subject of quantum mechanics. His driver had heard his lecture many times and joked with Planck that he could deliver it word for word. So the plot was hatched for the driver to deliver the lecture and for Planck to sit in the audience dressed as the driver. The driver delivered the lecture word perfectly to great applause. After the applause died down one of the physics professors in the audience asked an extremely difficult question. The driver replied without hesitation, “I am surprised that at such a learned university we get such a basic question. Why, it’s so simple even my driver could answer!” I want BST students to have the quick wittedness, sense of fun, risk taking mindset and flexibility of the driver and the in-depth applicable knowledge of Max Planck. The driver proves that on the surface you can learn something by heart, but not know it in depth. For years our educational systems were ‘an inch deep and a mile wide,’ great for winning ‘Trivial Pursuits’ but not for the demands of the middle 21st century. Here at BST we use our core values to produce happy and productive members of a global society. Everyone in our community should feel safe, accepted, known and successful.

The facilities and the educational approach enable students to question assumptions, discuss topics in depth and develop passions and interest in their subjects. BST provides students with a balance between structure within lessons and opportunities for students to follow their interests within the subjects. Furthermore, teachers design engaging, creative and active tasks, ensuring students can learn in ways that they find exciting and inspirational. At the heart of the learning and teaching process is the BST Learner Profile. Through this framework, students learn transferable knowledge, skills and dispositions that lead to a better understanding of the world and themselves. The English National Curriculum provides students with a rigorous and contextualised learning framework. This framework ensures students are challenged in their learning. The curriculum is further enhanced through the application of concept-based enquiry methods of teaching. The school’s highly qualified and experienced teaching staff are well versed in designing effective independent and collaborative learning activities and use the mode that best supports our intended aims. Teachers are encouraged to explore possibilities, innovate and develop their classroom practice confidently, linking to contemporary educational research. As a result, BST students develop an intrinsic love of learning, flourish, and are prepared for their futures.

The approach brings together two teaching practices - Enquiry-Based Learning and Concept-Based Learning. Enquiry-based learning focuses on the creation and investigation of questions as the focus of the learning. Students take an active role in both posing and answering questions. As they do so, they construct meaning and develop an understanding of the subject. When combined with Concept-Based Learning, those questions are designed to focus on transferable understandings or concepts. This approach helps students to see patterns, make connections, and apply their learning beyond the context of the lesson or subject. Students in the Primary School at BST use this approach when studying humanities and science-based subjects. For example, the concept of change can be investigated in science, geography and history. Students can connect their learning through the overriding concept as they establish their questions within each subject. This approach is being developed within Key Stage 3 (Years 7-9) and Key Stage 4 (Years 10-11). Whilst subjects are taught by subject specialists in the BST Secondary School, key concepts enable students to link their learning and form a deeper and more coherent understanding of the world. In Years 12 and 13, students can complement their A-level subjects by studying for the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ). The EPQ is an independent academic research project of the student's choice. Concept-Based Enquiry Learning strategies lie at the centre of this qualification and prepare students for the independent research projects they may undertake at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels at University.

We have adopted the term, ‘education for international mindedness’ - put simply, this means understanding, respecting and valuing different cultures, embracing diversity and knowing that different perspectives have a great deal to offer. Recognising and celebrating our modern British identity and our place at the heart of Japan’s capital city, we believe that there is no set approach to education for international mindedness. We place our focus on outcomes and the identification of key learning objectives that are attainable in a wide range of contexts at different developmental stages. At BST, we want our students: To have a strong sense of their own identity, values and perspectives as a first step to better understanding those of others To evolve their views over time as they come to better understand the world around them To embrace the similarities and differences between cultures and nationalities in ways that promote meaningful and lasting understanding and respect To have an appreciation for the increasing interconnectedness of the world and our interdependence as nations, communities and peoples To have or be willing to develop the ability to communicate in a variety of contexts in more than one language To be critical thinkers who understand the complexity of real-world challenges and value their responsibility and unique ability to be part of the solutions We realise that students will develop their own interpretations and channels of expression in response to education for international mindedness. As such, we expect and encourage a range of outcomes in addition to those defined above. Equally, we accept that international mindedness is a lifetime process rather than a final goal and that school is a step in that development. Students at BST come from a range of diverse backgrounds and cultures. Within this fluid and shifting environment, students ponder their individuality, their cultural heritage and their role in participating in the global community. The ability to appreciate and consider different perspectives with a critical eye is a skill that requires commitment from the entire school community. The BST Community, September 2020 Our Japanese Context BST makes extensive use of the rich historical, natural and cultural experiences available in Japan. Our children from Nursery upwards study the Japanese language. We maximise children’s real use of the language within the local community, taking advantage of speaking and listening opportunities right on our doorstep. For example, our Year 3 children interview people in the local area in Japanese about their hobbies, drawing on what they have learnt in the classroom about describing their own hobbies. We celebrate and participate in Japanese traditions both by learning the language and by exploring the local and national cultural traditions. Our skill based curriculum enables us to incorporate learning of skills relevant to our local context. Our history curriculum lends itself well to this. Year 2 children for example develop their history skills such as interpreting source materials when learning about the Great Fire of London and the Great Fire of Edo. Our BST Outdoor programme enables us to explore and appreciate the natural aspect of living in Japan. Children have opportunities to hike and learn about indigenous plants and natural vegetation whilst also appreciating geographical features, utilising both science and geography skills. We have strong links with our Japanese partner schools SKG and SWU as well as other Japanese schools in and around Tokyo with whom we share regular exchange days to enhance language and social opportunities.

We believe children learn best by ‘doing’ and having real-life learning experiences. It is through these authentic experiences that children can formulate their own ideas and opinions and make connections with the world around them; in a space where every individual is valued and feels a sense of belonging. Our new campus provides ample opportunities for a wide range of open-ended learning experiences, where our children can explore and apply their knowledge and understanding in specially designed rooms and spaces that encourage deeper thinking. In line with the Reggio Emilia principles, our learning environments are viewed as ‘the third teacher’. They follow a simple, neutral colour theme with the intention of creating a calming atmosphere, where the children’s learning brings the colour to the space. Displays within these spaces highlight the process of learning, with the children’s ideas and thoughts at the centre.

Our spaces promote independence and group work, and are designed so that resources are easily accessible and on hand to support learning. There are opportunities for students to investigate concepts and lines of inquiry they are exploring within the classroom, in an open but guided environment. The additional space gives a fantastic opportunity for the children to lead their own learning - developing both creativity and resilience.

There is usually a small amount of hiking required to access most courses, but once in the canyon, nearly 80% of the time is spent in the water. Rafting is the sport of negotiating your way down a river, which may have different levels of rough or even white water, in an inflatable raft and working together as part of a team to achieve a common goal. Not only great fun but excellent for teamwork and communication. 8.

Students travel to Canyons Outdoor centre in Okutama, Tokyo prefecture, where they take part in outdoor activities led by the Canyons instructors, under the supervision of BST staff. Canyoning is the sport of negotiating your way down canyons by employing various techniques including abseiling, jumping waterfalls and cliffs, cascading down natural chutes and water slides, swimming through crystal clear pools and using special rope systems, such as flying foxes. There is usually a small amount of hiking required to access most courses, but once in the canyon, nearly 80% of the time is spent in the water. Rafting is the sport of negotiating your way down a river, which may have different levels of rough or even white water, in an inflatable raft and working together as part of a team to achieve a common goal. Not only great fun but excellent for teamwork and communication. 9.

From the play-based environment of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), characterised by sustained development, to the dynamic, rigorous experience in Year 1 through to Year 6 - students flourish personally, socially and academically. The variety of opportunities students access provides the ideal start to their education. The formative elements of literacy and numeracy are established and ensure continued academic success. Furthermore, students become excited about their learning and have the opportunity to discover and nurture their unique talents and interests. Understanding the world is a specific learning area in the Early Years Foundation Stage. However, this theme runs through the entire Primary School. Students develop their understanding of the world around them during lessons and experience residential trips for the first time.

It is widely understood that significant physical and academic development in children happens during this formative period of their lives. The quality and scope of early childhood education have a considerable impact on children's future lives. Thus a play-based approach founded on educational research that emphasises creativity, investigation and personalisation is a vital feature at BST. Enquire Now Admissions Process Enquire Visit Give At BST, experienced educators track, plan and tailor learning opportunities for each child to ensure they progress in all curriculum areas. Teachers continuously assess their progress, thus adjusting learning to meet each child's individual needs. The child's experience of this play-based approach enables them to have fun, make friends, learn to cooperate, learn about the world and develop essential reading, writing and mathematics skills. To see this approach in action and to discuss our Early Years provision in more detail, please do come and visit us . Early Years  Foundation Stage Curriculum Learn through play Interior Setting Curriculum The BST Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) incorporates both Nursery and Reception classes. This stage of schooling promotes young children's social, emotional, academic and physical development. A high quality Early Years provision, like that at BST, leads to improved academic results further up the school, better career opportunities and improved physical and emotional health as students grow into adulthood. EYFS has seven areas of learning and development: Personal, Social and Emotional Development Communication and Language English Mathematics Physical Development Understanding the World Expressive arts and design In line with the Reggio Emilia principles BST employs , children’s views and interests are used to inform the planning of learning opportunities both in the outdoor and indoor settings. To extend the children’s learning and make it a more meaningful experience, the children are encouraged to bring in and talk about books or items of interest related to their topics. Maximum class size is 20 in Nursery and Reception. Each class has one teacher and one education assistant. Learn through play Play is at the core of the EYFS Curriculum at BST, underpinning all aspects of child development. Through both child-led and open-ended play, children have the opportunity to develop key problem-solving skills, support social engagement and allow students to delve deeper into their own learning journeys. Play itself gives children different sensory, physical and cognitive experiences that are essential to build deeper connections in the brain. Play-based learning helps a child develop holistically, promoting confidence and motivation, and practicing cognitive skills. Through a play-based approach, children are motivated to take on new challenges which are purposeful and meaningful. Students have the opportunity to engage both independently and collectively alongside their peers as they take on new challenges whether that be building a new track out of complex construction materials or experimenting with colour mixing in the painting areas. A play-based learning approach at BST consists of carefully planned and well-resourced areas of learning, allowing students to choose their own activities and challenges for the day as they pursue their own interests. There is always an array of opportunities available to students to develop their own lines of inquiry. Play in itself allows students to progress right across the curriculum where passionate EY staff are always on hand to support and extend learners through high quality questioning techniques. Areas of learning are adjusted to meet the needs of the cohort as well as developed over time to support focussed inputs that take place throughout the play, providing real-life learning experiences to all students. Interior Setting The environments within BST’s Azabudai Hills Campus are largely influenced by the Reggio Emilia approach to education. We believe children learn best by ‘doing’ and having real-life learning experiences. It is through these authentic experiences that children can formulate their own ideas and opinions and make connections with the world around them; in a space where every individual is valued and feels a sense of belonging. Our new campus provides ample opportunities for a wide range of open-ended learning experiences, where our children can explore and apply their knowledge and understanding in specially designed rooms and spaces that encourage deeper thinking.

All adults in the school have a responsibility for the safeguarding of students. We provide a caring, positive, safe and stimulating environment that promotes all students' welfare and well-being. What is Safeguarding? Safeguarding is the action taken to promote children's welfare and protect them from harm. Safeguarding means: protecting children from abuse and maltreatment preventing harm to children’s health or development ensuring children grow up with the provision of safe and effective care taking action to enable all children and young people to have the best outcomes. Child protection is part of the safeguarding process. It focuses on protecting individual children identified as suffering or likely to suffer significant harm. This includes child protection procedures which detail how to respond to concerns about a child. BST’s Designated Safeguarding Leads (DSL) team is specifically trained to manage safeguarding situations and coordinate information gathering and responses. They act as a source of support, advice and expertise to staff on matters of safety and safeguarding and have knowledge of the local Safeguarding and Child Protection laws and regulations. DSLs and the wider staff receive regular training, accessing best practices internationally. Our Safeguarding and Child Protection Policy informs Trustees, BST staff, students & their families and all external providers & volunteers about the school’s responsibilities for safeguarding children. If you have any safeguarding concerns, please contact the relevant DSL directly: Whole School Designated Safeguarding Person David James djames@bst.ac.jp Primary, Azabudai Hills Campus Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) Rebecca Remnant rremnant@bst.ac.jp Secondary, Showa Campus Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) Duncan Grey dgrey@bst.ac.jp Whole School Designated Trustee for Safeguarding and Child Protection Comino Tamura ctamura@bst.ac.jp Footer Container Footer Background Footer Icon Links Enquire Apply Contact Giving Footer Main Container Footer Site Info Container Footer Logo THE BRITISH SCHOOL IN TOKYO Footer Blurb We look to nurture each student’s unique potential and strive to help them create a strong sense of self, built around purpose and passion.

The BST specialist counselling team supports our students, and their families, through one-to-one, class and transition sessions. The school Counselling Team also supports teachers and parents by sharing expertise through consultations, workshops and social events.

This involves care and management of illness, first aid and emergency response and psychological care. The nursing team manages all medical care plans, liaises with parents and staff, and remains on call throughout the school day to ensure that all students stay safe and well cared for on campus.

Students are guided and supported by highly knowledgeable and expert teachers who care passionately about their continual progress. Students are further supported through BST's vertical tutor groups comprising students from each Key Stage. Students learn from and support each other with the help of their form tutor. BST form tutors take great pride in having an in-depth, personalised overview of each student's academic and pastoral needs and are, therefore, the first point of contact for all parents. At BST, we aim to provide an all-around educational experience so that students become confident and caring members of the local, national and global community. Students leave the Secondary School equipped with the tools that will enable them to move onto the next stage of their lives with confidence, conviction and a growth mindset.

BST staff ensure that the learning from Primary into Secondary is consistent and use the attributes embedded in the Learner Profile to support the transition. The Key Stage 3 Curriculum for Years 7 to 9 is designed to give students depth and breadth in their studies. It is also carefully crafted to allow students to explore ideas across subject areas, develop interests and pursue passions. Founded on the English National Curriculum and tailored to meet BST's context, learning in Years 7 to 9 seeks to develop students' inquiry skills, problem-solving and critical thinking within the context of the wider world. Key Stage 4 (Years 10 and 11) begins the students' GCSE journey. The Secondary School utilises a combination of GCSE and (I)GCSEs to ensure that learning is bespoke to our British and international student body. The (I)GCSE qualifications include external exams set and marked by independent, internationally-recognised bodies and are taken at the end of Year 11. Each student can shape their curriculum through their subject choices, allowing them to pursue their passions and excel in their chosen areas of study.

These are schools that share a common philosophy—a commitment to high quality, challenging, international education that The British School in Tokyo believes is important for our students. The IB Diploma programme will run in Years 12 and 13. As well as academic success – you can read about our examination results – what happens outside the classroom is of great importance. BST provides a holistic education to produce well rounded young adults. A full enrichment programme is offered and this provides an opportunity to develop personalities, leadership skills, community spirit and self-confidence. There are abundant opportunities to participate and compete in Music, Drama, Sport, Service and other activities. The BST Outdoors programme is a unique feature of our educational provision and all students go on both a summer and winter trip to the Japanese Alps. Being involved in the life of BST, taking responsibility and maximising the opportunities for personal development is central to the life of a BST Senior School student. This is reflected in the mature attitude of our students, both academically and socially, and how they carry out their duties as prefects. Starting from August 2024, BST will be offering BTEC Level 3 in Enterprise and Sport . These courses have been selected to complement our existing A-Level offerings, providing a robust and varied curriculum that caters to the diverse interests and career aspirations of our students. We also aim to prepare students for later life and have support for university applications and careers including a Work Experience programme and various seminars and lectures on a vast range of topics.

The International Baccalaureate (IB) is a not-for-profit foundation, motivated by its mission to create a better world through education. It aims to develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect. IB programmes encourage students across the world to become active, compassionate and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right. What is IBDP? The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) is an assessed programme for students aged 16 to 19. It is respected by leading universities across the globe. The Diploma Programme (DP) curriculum is made up of six subject groups and the DP core, comprising theory of knowledge (TOK), creativity, activity, service (CAS) and the extended essay. Through the DP core, students reflect on the nature of knowledge, complete independent research and undertake a project that often involves community service. © International Baccalaureate Organization 2018 Why IBDP? International research shows that there are many benefits to choosing IBDP. For example: DP students enrol, persist and graduate at higher rates than the national average in a study about postsecondary outcomes of DP graduates in the United States . IB students studying at higher education institutions in the United Kingdom have greater odds of achieving positive higher education outcomes than their A-level peers, according to a study comparing student performance . On average, DP alumni reported higher capacities for a variety of 21st-century skills compared to their non-DP counterparts according to a study in Asia-Pacific . IB Learner Profile The IB learner profile is the IB mission statement translated into a set of learning outcomes for the 21st century.

Furthermore, it creates a platform for students to build their leadership skills and positively impact the school and the broader community. Multiple groups within the Primary and Secondary Schools represent students and ensure leadership translates into positive action. Primary School Student Council As the Primary School is currently accommodated on two campuses, each campus has its own Primary School Student Council. Each Primary class elects two representatives for the Council. During the year, the Council is involved in several exciting projects, and the Councillors share their ideas for school improvement with the Primary School Leadership Team. The Councillors then take this information back to their peers in their classrooms. House Captains The House Captains are role models for the other students in their House. Modelling the BST Way is an essential aspect of their role. Additionally, The House Captains are responsible for organising a termly house event. House events include competitions between the houses in various subjects and organising charitable activities, often collaborating with Secondary School House Captains. Wellbeing Ambassadors BST Wellbeing Ambassadors meet weekly and work with staff to organise events promoting emotional health and wellbeing. Wellbeing Week is one of these events and is their primary focus. Wellbeing Week focuses on the Five Ways to Wellbeing - Take Notice, Be Active, Connect, Give and Keep Learning. Students focus on one of these aspects daily and work on activities connected to them. The week concludes with an assembly led by the Ambassadors concentrating on giving and gratitude. Art Ambassadors Art Ambassadors meet to discuss upcoming art projects and exhibitions. The Art Ambassadors have been involved in projects such as wearable art and are responsible for promoting whole school art initiatives. Art Ambassadors are also positive role models for their peers and will mentor others to encourage a love for art. Sports Leaders BST Sports Leaders meet half termly and provide a voice for the students regarding many aspects of PE and Sport. These students are a channel for feedback regarding PE and Sports clubs, the PE uniform and charitable sporting activities. Sports Leaders plan and organise sports-focused assemblies and are invaluable in supporting the teachers to plan and run the Primary Sports Days. Secondary School Prefects The Prefect Team are central to life in the Secondary School. The election process is similar to the Primary School, and several students are appointed to different positions. While being an essential vehicle for student voices and views, the group also organises many school-wide events. These have included charity sales, baking competitions, discos and trips. They are also involved in a regional organisation called ‘Kanto Plains’, which links different student leadership groups from other schools. In addition to the Head Prefects, there are the following prefect teams: Service Senior School Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Wellbeing Culture and Community Student Council eCool (environment and sustainability) House Leadership Teams The House Leadership Teams include the House Captain, Vice-Captain, one Key Stage 4 (Years 10-11) representative and one Key Stage 3 (Years 7-9) representative. These students meet weekly to plan House assemblies, intra and inter-House competitions, various seasonal events and tutor time activities. Through these mediums, the House Leadership Teams build House pride and identity and significantly impact the enjoyment and support available to all students in their House. Sports Council The Secondary Sports Council comprises a Sports Captain, Vice-Captain and Key Stage Representatives for each House. In addition to organising teams for various inter-house school events and promoting them, they provide a strong student voice regarding curriculum PE and extra-curricular sports. Subject Ambassadors Subject Ambassadors meet regularly in their teams to plan and lead subject-related events, such as assemblies or competitions. They use their passion and knowledge to promote their subjects throughout the year.

The health, personal and character benefits, linked to the BST Learner Profile , that these experiences provide are considerable. Developing talents and establishing positive habits that last a lifetime, begin the moment students join BST. From Nursery through to Year 13, sport is an integral part of life at The British School in Tokyo (BST). Experienced specialist teachers deliver lessons that foster a lifelong love of physical activity, emphasizing teamwork, respect, and a positive attitude. Students learn to win and lose gracefully while developing the ability to evaluate their own and others' performances. The P.E. department ensures all students make progress and enjoy a variety of opportunities within and beyond the curriculum, from fundamental skill development to representing the school at local, national, and international levels. Swimming is a key component of the P.E. curriculum, taught from Nursery by specialist coaches. Pupils in Years 1–6 receive weekly swimming and personal survival lessons, while secondary students continue swimming as part of their KS3 P.E. program. Beyond lessons, BST's extra-curricular sports clubs offer a pathway from recreational participation to excellence, with opportunities to represent the school at events such as the international FOBISIA Games. Curriculum FOBISIA Lions Clubs Developmental Clubs Recreational Clubs External Partnerships Facilities Curriculum P.E. is a vital part of the curriculum at BST, supporting students' development from Nursery through to Year 13. Inspired by the British National Curriculum and enriched by international influences, the program incorporates the BST Learner Profile to encourage teamwork, leadership, and risk-taking. Students are assessed using the \"Head, Heart, Hands\" model, evaluating their knowledge, influence on others, and physical skills. From building FUNdamental skills in Nursery to exploring a broad range of activities by Year 13, the program fosters a lifelong love of physical activity to support fitness and wellbeing. Led by specialized P.E. teachers, the curriculum provides Primary students with indoor, outdoor, and swimming lessons each week, with EYFS beginning swimming in the summer term. Lessons integrate cross-curricular links, such as movement in gymnastics, rhythm in dance, and understanding the body’s physical and mental responses to exercise. Students engage in a variety of activities, including team sports, gymnastics, dance, and athletics, as well as swimming, where they learn strokes, personal survival, and water-based activities like water polo and artistic swimming. Aims Develop physically literate students with the competence, motivation, and confidence to make physical activity a central part of life. Foster individual, group, and team skills, emphasizing fairness, responsibility, and emotional intelligence. Encourage leadership, coaching, and officiating, teaching effectiveness in competitive and creative situations. Build diverse skills, tactics, and strategies while reflecting on and improving performance. Promote healthy, active lifestyles and the role of sport in achieving them. Inspire students to try new skills, ignite passion for physical activity, and support overall wellbeing. Course Content Students will complete units in Invasion Games, Net Games, and Striking & Fielding Games. They will also participate in an Aquatics Unit, choosing either personal survival, lifesaving, and water polo or a \"learn to swim\" pathway as a participant or leader. Additionally, students will explore Aesthetic activities such as Aerial Arts, Gymnastics, Parkour, Dance, or Freestyle Football, prepare for Sports Day with Athletics, and cover Health-Related Exercise and Outdoor Adventurous Activities throughout KS3. FOBISIA FOBISIA The FOBISIA Friendly Games are competitions encompassing both individual activities and team sports. They have a long-standing reputation for being the most popular events in the FOBISIA calendar that offer students a fantastic opportunity to compete at the highest levels, but at the same time, the opportunity for our students to form global friendships with their peers throughout the region. Since 2023 BST has participated in the Primary FOBISIA Friendly Games in Thailand. Following a fair trial process at the start of the academic year, a squad of girls and boys is selected to represent the school at U11 (Y5/6) and U13 (Y7/8). Training takes place throughout the year culminating in pupils competing in 4 different sports at the games. Hockey at BST is delivered in the curriculum throughout all year groups to both boys and girls. This allows the students to be taught a number of skills and principles of the game and give them a taste of what the sport is about. We also offer Hockey as an extracurricular activity from Year 4 through to Year 9. This is a chance for students to further improve their skills and game based knowledge. In the high school (Year 10,11,12, 13) we enter the Varsity Kanto plains tournament and play competitive fixtures during Term 2. We have a squad of 16 players who train twice a week during the competitive season. Hockey at BST is a popular sport and has really developed over the past few years. Lions Clubs Lions Clubs BST Lions is our strand of clubs for pupils wishing to compete at a higher level in our main competitive sports. This involves pre-season trials and weekly training sessions for those selected and the opportunity to participate in fixtures and tournaments over the course of the season. In Primary School, we are linked with schools through ISTAA (International Schools Tokyo Athletics Association) who collaborate across the year to give pupils opportunities to compete in tournaments for football, basketball and cross country. The schools also collaborate to put on inter-school activities such as dance, badminton, tag rugby and cricket. In Secondary School, competitive sport for both girls and boys is split into 4 main sports across the year; football, volleyball, basketball & futsal. Teams compete at Middle School (Y7-9) and High School (Y10-13) level. Each season consists of regular fixtures and end of season tournaments against other international schools in Tokyo. Teams are also invited to WJAA (Western Japan Athletic Association) tournaments for volleyball, football and basketball. Swimming: Once selected for the swimming team, pupils will train weekly all year round and will have the opportunity to be selected for swim meets against other international schools suitable for their experience. Our squad programmes in Primary, and Secondary School focus on the competitive edge with a major emphasis on technique, stamina and speed. Developmental Clubs Developmental Clubs At Primary level, developmental sport is about giving pupils not in the Lions set-up, a unique chance to participate in a different sport as well as the opportunity to play a friendly game with another school gaining confidence and experience along the way. In Secondary, at middle school level, those not selected for BST Lions teams are given the opportunity to continue to access the competitive sports through the development squads. Students receive weekly training and access a competitive environment within a more friendly jamboree experience Recreational Clubs Recreational Clubs We provide a broad range of activities to inspire a lifelong love of physical activity. These are a mixture of individual and team clubs allowing students to build on their experiences in the PE curriculum. Recreational swimming for both primary and secondary students is geared towards pupils wishing to improve their confidence in the water.

From Early Years to senior students, our programme encourages exploration of diverse artistic mediums and techniques, inspiring students to develop their unique artistic voice. Guided by skilled teachers, students engage in projects that celebrate cultural diversity, history, and innovation, while cultivating a lifelong appreciation for the arts and their role in shaping the world. Primary School Secondary School Primary School In Primary School, students engage in a diverse range of artistic disciplines, including drawing, painting, sculpture, textiles, and woodwork. They are encouraged to creatively explore various materials and experiment with innovative ideas to cultivate their unique artistic expressions. By studying the works of both contemporary and traditional artists, craftspeople, and designers, students draw inspiration for their own creations while deepening their understanding of art and design. In the Early Years , students explore mark-making and a variety of materials, including paint, clay, recycled items, and loose parts, to express both real and imaginary concepts. As they enhance their knowledge of tools and materials, they pursue personal interests, engage in inquiries, and develop critical thinking skills. During Key Stage 1 , students are introduced to fundamental skills in drawing, painting, printing, textiles, and sculpture, allowing them to share their ideas, experiences, and imaginations. They engage with artworks from various artists and are encouraged to reflect on and relate these works to their own artistic endeavors. In Key Stage 2 , students refine their artistic techniques and mastery of materials, delving deeper into the works of influential artists, architects, and designers throughout history. They begin utilising sketchbooks to document their creative journeys and develop their concepts further. Art Studio Facilities Our Art Studio is well-equipped with spacious tables and a diverse array of materials, including paints, mark-making tools, clay, and resources for printing and woodworking. Additionally, shared areas and balconies on every floor offer a variety of art supplies, fostering collaboration and creativity among students. Secondary School In the Secondary School, the Art and Design Curriculum provides students with opportunities to explore visual, tactile and other sensory experiences in order to communicate ideas and meanings. It is important that our students reflect critically on their own and other people’s work through given themes, judging quality, value and meaning. In Years 7-9 , all students explore a wide range of media and ideas, developing creativity and critical thinking through the subject. Students will have the opportunity to visit exhibitions and generate cross-curricular links with other departments to broaden their understanding of the real-world applications of Art. In Years 10 and 11 , we offer GCSE Art and Design (Edexcel). We encourage students to develop their visual language in a wider and more experimental form to appreciate and achieve artistic intentions. Students embark on a range of workshops and trips to enhance their classroom experience. In Years 12 and 13 , our students enjoy intimate classes, which promote individual guidance. We A Level Art and Design (Edexcel) and, for those who wish to specialise, we prepare students for entry to Foundation courses in the UK. All A-level students are provided with their own working environment and they are encouraged to develop their work during study periods and after school. We have two art rooms: one provides access to digital and photography equipment to support students who wish to explore CAD/CAM. Our Art Studio offers a range of machinery for textiles and excellently resourced materials for drawing, painting, printmaking, mixed media and sculpture.

Engagement in drama is essential as part of an arts-rich curriculum that every student has a right to experience. Through Drama, students become familiar with the culture and conventions of theatre and learn to exercise critical judgement when: making; performing; and responding to a range of styles and genres. Drama is a unique subject area with a curriculum that gives them the opportunity to invent and imagine stories old and new, through a range of dramatic techniques, which gives them increased confidence in a range of performance-based situations. Students are given the opportunity to enhance their speaking and listening skills in a challenging, creative and exciting way. Analysis of plays and performances also gives pupils the chance to critique and voice their own opinions in an encouraging and controlled manner. This also allows students to be able to understand the complex levels involved in stories and to convey their meaning to an audience. Students learn the foundations of Drama: communication; concentration; and co-operation. They are encouraged to work as part of a team, giving them the opportunity to contribute and collaborate with others and also to experience how to manage and lead a group. By being directed and giving direction, students learn how to express their ideas confidently and also how to use their vocal and physical presence to the best of their ability. Drama is a valuable experience and crucial element of the curriculum to give our students the skills, knowledge and confidence necessary for their future. Primary School Secondary School Primary School Whilst not taught as a standalone subject in Primary School, drama is used throughout the curriculum, bringing subjects to life and allowing students to explore themes, concepts and dilemmas through creative expression and collaboration. Furthermore, the extensive Primary Extra-curricular Activities provide extensive opportunities for drama, particularly the highly acclaimed annual Primary Production. 2023-2024 production “The Amazing Adventures of Superstan” was a true ‘marvel’ for BST Primary as the inaugural Primary Production at the Azabudai Hills Campus. The BST Primary Production plays a crucial role in nurturing students' artistic expression and personal growth. Participation enhances creativity, boosts confidence and teaches teamwork, preparing students for well-rounded futures. Secondary School At Key Stage 3, all students have Drama Lessons thrice fortnightly and it forms a key part of their curriculum. Students have the opportunity to engage with many different performance skills, techniques and ideas through exploring a plethora of texts, styles and key periods in theatre history. At Key Stage 4, students can opt for the popular IGCSE Drama course. In addition to the skills mentioned above, students are given a further insight into the world of theatre by creating and watching devised and scripted performances. Students are invited to build upon their already existing skills as theatre-makers and experience the role of not only a performer but also a director and designer. At KS5, students who choose Theatre for their Group 6 choice at IB will take their current Drama skills to the next echelon. They will develop a knowledge of practitioners, various styles and are subject to a range of international texts. 2023-2024 production \"High School Musical,\" performed by our talented secondary students, was a remarkable showcase of creativity, teamwork, and dedication. It not only provided an entertaining experience for the audience but also served as a powerful educational tool, contributing to the personal and artistic growth of all participants. We look forward to more such enriching and memorable productions in the future.

If you have any questions about  the contents or suggestions for additions or revisions, please contact the Deputy Principal, David James at djames@bst.ac.jp . BST Earthquake Procedures What Parents Do Other Useful Links BST Earthquake Procedures In the event of a major earthquake, the school will follow the procedures below: All children will be kept at the school until collected Children will be kept inside the school buildings unless there is a danger of building collapse or fire, or the buildings are considered unsafe for other reasons; this is because at Azabudai Hills the streets are likely to be more dangerous than inside our building and at Showa the campus may become very crowded as it is a public evacuation site If evacuations of the buildings are necessary, children will be taken to the evacuation sites; at Azabudai Hills, the evacuation site is Azabudai Hills Central Park; at Showa, the evacuation site is initially the Astroturf in the centre of the campus and then the Cafeteria on the far side of the Astroturf if that building is safe The school bus between Showa and Azabudai Hills will not run All clubs and events will be cancelled No children will be allowed to leave the school site on their own, unless we receive permission after the earthquake from parents No children will be allowed to leave the school sites with the parents of other children, unless we receive permission from parents after the earthquake Children will be kept at the school for as long as necessary, including overnight or for several nights if required; we have blankets, emergency equipment and sufficient emergency food and water for 3 days Children on residential trips will stay at the residential centre, and children on day trips from school will stay with staff at their location until we are able to communicate with parents What Parents Do After an earthquake, look at the BST Facebook page , BST on Twitter , the BST  Website and/or your email to find out if the school considers this to be a major earthquake and to obtain information on the current situation at the  school; as general guidance, the school will normally consider a major  earthquake to be one which is announced by Japanese media, such as  NHK, as Shindo 5 or above in Tokyo or  where the Tokyo trains and subway stop and do not resume within one hour If you are unable to access the internet or email, assume that the school will be following the emergency procedures above; keep checking the internet sites periodically as they may come back online Come to collect your children when it is safe for you to do so; because of  fallen obstacles, fires, or dangerously crowded streets, it may not be safe for  you and your children to be on the streets; this is more likely in the case of an  earthquake which is announced as Shindo 6 or above; in this case, please  do not rush to the school; we will keep your children until it is safe for you to  collect them; this may be many hours later or the next day If all communication fails, your children will be kept at the school (or at the  evacuation sites, if it is necessary to evacuate the school buildings), for  several days if necessary, until you collect them or are able to contact the school with alternative arrangements Do not telephone the school. Look at the website, Twitter feed or Facebook No students will be released from school unless a parent or carer comes to pick them up or we receive permission after the earthquake from parents. We will release children to adults other than their parent/carer only if we  receive written authorisation after an earthquake from parents.

Therefore we take emergency preparedness very seriously at our School. Three core principles inform our approach. 1. Good Planning 2. Careful Preparation 3. Effective Communication 1. Good Planning 1. Good Planning Health, safety and emergency issues are overseen by the Principal and Deputy Principal. The school maintains close links with local authorities, emergency services, the British Embassy and other relevant bodies in Tokyo, and seeks advice from emergency consultants to develop and refine our emergency procedures. Additionally the school employs a Health & Safety Officer. The Health and Safety Officer, works closely with the Deputy Principal and plays a key role for all matters relating to Health and Safety. All risk assessments for off-site trips and expeditions must refer specifically to earthquake preparedness and, where necessary, advance contact will be made with local authorities and emergency organisations in order to gain an understanding of any specific requirements related to the area of the visit. 2. Careful Preparation 2. Careful Preparation We have ensured that the School is well resourced. We have ‘Classroom Emergency Kits’ in all teaching and administrative areas that will provide for the needs of students and staff in the immediate aftermath of an emergency (food, water, head protection, warmth, first aid, sanitation and ‘TLC’). We have supplemented these with ‘Emergency Resource Points’ that contain supplementary provisions and resources to provide for the whole School’s needs for a period of up to 72 hours, if necessary. If a group leaves either School site, a ‘Go Pack’ is taken to provide for first aid, earthquake preparedness and ‘TLC’ in case of an emergency. Emergency communication procedures when students are off site on school trips, including residential visits, are always carefully explained in the information sent out to parents in advance. Both School sites have an ‘Emergency Communication Kit’ allowing us to both receive and provide information as and when needed. These packs include radio-telephones, two way radios and provision for other methods of electronic communication (mobile phone, email, website, Twitter etc) and small solar panels for recharging. Finally ‘Search & Rescue Kits’ are stored in appropriate locations on both sites to equip rescue teams with lifting and wreckage clearance gear if required. The School routinely trains and drills its staff and students. 3. Effective Communication 3.

View Vacancies Our Faculty ASIJ doesnât expect teachers to be perfect. Rather, we recruit experienced, child-centered educators who possess values, dispositions, and skills that align closely to our strategic vision for ASIJâs future and are always eager to learn and grow as professionals.Â ASIJ invites serious candidates to explore three documents to understand what ASIJ is looking for and whether we offer the right fit: (1) our Strategic Design Framework (SDF) is a one-page strategic plan with four interdependent dimensions that illustrate our vision for the future and how we plan to get there; (2) our Portrait of a Learner is central to our SDF and to implementation of Deep Learning; and (3) our Professional Standards for Growth & Excellence are nuanced, strategic, and contextualized to ASIJ and purpose-built to support our SDF. Teacher Qualifications All candidates for full-time faculty positions must have received a BA or BS from an accredited university or college. Graduate degrees are preferred. Applicants must have an active teaching license from a state, province, or governmental authority and certification that covers the specific teaching assignment for which they are applying, both in subject matter or specialized role and grade level. Candidates need to have at least 5 years of full-time classroom experience, including two years in an assignment similar to the one for which they are applying. ASIJ gives priority to candidates who have training and experience with specific curriculum or programs. These priorities are detailed in the job descriptions posted for each role. Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion ASIJ believes in the inherent value and dignity of each individual and is committed to knowing, valuing, and caring for each member of our community. We believe that each individual deserves to experience a full sense of belonging where they are seen, heard, honored, valued, and supported as their authentic selves. When each person can experience safety and share their identities, perspectives, and experiences, the whole community benefits as we form human connections, better understand our diverse and complex world, and unlock our collective creativity. To that end, ASIJ is committed to being a community that actively advances diversity, equity, and inclusion and challenges oppression, racism, and exclusion. This commitment demands intentional institutional reflection and a willingness to change. It requires eliminating barriers to full participation and building systems and culture that support diverse individuals and groups. In order to advance this commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion and ensure our actions align with our words, ASIJ is seeking candidates to join our faculty who will bring diverse perspectives and experiences. Factors that contribute to diversity include but are not limited to race, ethnicity, culture, sex, gender identification, sexual orientation, social or economic status, age, (dis)ability status, linguistic background, religion, or country of origin, as well as the complex intersection of these factors. Beyond the Classroom Co-curricular programs are an integral part of the ASIJ student experience, providing opportunities where many students find their element. We believe great coaches and sponsors have an indelible impact on young people, allowing them to develop their passions; learn resilience, responsibility, teamwork; and perform or compete with confidence. All teachers are expected to actively lead as coaches, club sponsors, or supervisors within our schoolâs extensive co-curricular program. Therefore, ASIJ gives priority to candidates who have deep experience and training in specific co-curricular needs. Safeguarding ASIJ is committed to upholding a safe and secure school environment for all members of the community, as outlined in our Safeguarding policies and procedures.Â Our policies provide for robust prevention and response protocols around safe hiring; annual employee training on issues of abuse, neglect, and exploitation of children; and holding members of our community accountable for violations. Prior to employment, all faculty and staff are required to sign a behavioral agreement of safe practices with children and to undergo a background check.Â Learn More on Safeguarding Our home in Japan ASIJ is located in one of Asiaâs most modern and cosmopolitan capital cities. Served by two international airports, Tokyo is a global hub, a financial center, and the gateway to Japan. From sub-tropical islands in the south, to the snowy northern island of Hokkaido, Japan offers residents everything from world-class diving to Olympic standard winter sports facilities. With a rich, unique cultural tradition and a technologically driven society, Japan offers a vibrant contrast between the old and new. Tokyo is one of the worldâs safest major cities and offers a high standard of living and excellent quality of life for expatriates, due to its world-class infrastructure, low health risks, low air pollution, and low crime rates. A thriving and diverse cultural landscape encompases major museums and galleries, a vibrant local music scene, traditional festivals and activities, performances by internationally renowned musicians, and major theme parks all of which make life in Tokyo a rich and entertaining experience. Japan also offers sports fans the opportunity to attend many major athletic events and the country has played host to the FIFA World Cup, Rugby World Cup, and both the summer and winter Olympics.Â Candidates should note, however, that most foreign-hire teachers live near the main campus in Chofu, a suburban environment one hour west of central Tokyo by train. Teachers at our Early Learning Center in Roppongi typically live in neighborhoods in central Tokyo closer to their campus. Next to the Chofu campus is gorgeous Nogawa Park offering 200 acres of walking and bike paths, tennis courts, playgrounds, and wide open spaces. Close by is the Tama River recreation area, with a bike path extending 40 km from Haneda Airport to the foothills surrounding the city. Some families opt to live close to the school campus, while others may choose to live a little further away in the nearby neighborhood of Kichijoji, which offers a wide range of entertainment activities, shopping, and restaurants.Â The weather in Tokyo is seasonal. Hot and humid summers are bookended by rainy and typhoon seasons, while mild autumn and winter months boast beautiful blue skies. Spring in Tokyo offers beauty that is second to none: picturesque cherry blossoms as far as the eye can see.

See More ASIJ Stories â Additional Links About ASIJ / Alumni / Visit / Partner with ASIJ / ASIJ Stories / Sitemap Our Community With exceptional students, inspiring teachers, and engaged parents, we foster a nurturing environment that values character, curiosity, and cross-cultural connections. Our Students âMy students are driven to do well but they also have inquisitive minds to where they are excited to learn beyond the curriculum when they can. In addition to their academics, they bring great personalities which help to create a positive school environment. In short, theyâre a really nice group of kids.â â Middle School Science Teacher â Our students perform exceptionally well academicallyâas evidenced by their results on standardized testsâbut they are also well-rounded individuals who excel outside the classroom. They show their integrity and sense of responsibility through taking leadership roles and being constructive community members. They value sportsmanship, are honest and have integrity. They have the courage to stand up and present their own ideas and to take risks and try new things. They donât fear failure and have the resilience to persevere when things are difficult. They are empathetic and understand and respect diverse perspectives. They care about others, both in their school and local communities, and beyond. All this is a way of saying they embody the spirit of our mission and our core values of character, courage and compassion every day. Our Teachers âIt was like she wanted me to remember what she taught me for the rest of my life.â â High School Student â Research shows that an inspiring and highly-skilled teacher is the single most important school-related factor influencing student learning. Teachers at ASIJ care about their students, engage them, foster their sense of wonder and curiosity, help them weather challenges and mistakes, and encourage them to understand and explore their own capabilities and potential.ASIJ is very selective in its recruitment of teachers, attempting to identify and recruit outstanding teachers who possess the mindset, values, and skills that correspond with our commitment and mission. We also provide an outstanding professional learning program that helps teachers keep up-to-date on new research on how children learn, emerging technology tools for the classroom and new curriculum resources. ASIJâs faculty represent 14 different nationalities with the majority being US citizens. All are experienced teachers, with approximately 75% having earned post-graduate degrees. A quarter of our teachers choose to stay at ASIJ for 10 or more years. Our learning community consists of 162 full-time faculty, 22 assistant and part-time teachers and 96 staff.Â Our Parents âOne of the things we love about ASIJ is how easy it is to get involved. The school and PTA are happy to have you raise your hand, offer an idea, or give your time and talents. Getting involved from the start helped us make the most of our time in Japan.â â High School Parent â Opportunities for parent involvement abound at ASIJ, and parents are highly encouraged to participate in a variety of school-related activities. We have a highly engaged PTA with hundreds of active members. Through their thousands of annual volunteer hours, the school is able to create a welcoming environment for all, that is rich with community building events connecting our families, faculty and other community members. Parents are welcome to ride the bus to school and are encouraged to volunteer and take part in activities at school. Whether it is being a mystery reader, chaperoning a school trip, helping out in the library, attending the elementary school's Halloween Parade or watching the Senior Walk, parents play an active role in the day-to-day life of the school. Parents are also often encouraged to share their professions, expertise and hobbies with a classroom or grade level. Parents also play an important function in the governance of the school and some are invited to serve on our Board of Directors, Board of Trustees and various committees that work on behalf of the school. Our Home âWhile most of my Tokyo life was full of bright lights and tall buildings, I still have fond memories of my trip to Nagano in 10th grade, which brought me out into the daikon-fields of rural Japan. It reminded me that my home in Japan extended beyond city life to the mountains.â â Class of â15 Alumna â ASIJ has deep roots in Japan and over a century of cross-cultural collaboration. From experiencing sumo for the first time at the ELC to visiting Hiroshima in middle school or joining a marine biology trip to Izu, our curriculum provides students with authentic learning opportunities in Japan. ASIJâs Japan Center offers further meaningful cultural connections through lessons in calligraphy, tea ceremony, and kendo, as well as opportunities to learn from master craftsmen. Our unique Kyogen program has provided generations of students with the opportunity to dive deep into this art form, while our elementary students learn Nihon Buyo from world-renowned performers. Japan is also central to our service programs. Students have an impact in their host country through activities such as teaching English to students in Tohoku, teaching art to local community members with disabilities, supporting local teenagers as they leave the foster system, or making and sharing food with those less fortunate in Ueno Park. We know from our alumni that such experiences have an impact which stays with them long after they leave ASIJ Life at ASIJ Our Community Our Buses Our Year Activities, Arts, & Athletics Safeguarding at ASIJ Our Spaces In a metropolis like Tokyo, space is a valuable asset.

The scale and breadth of our program are unmatchedânot just in Japan. We believe that unique, challenging, and positive experiences help students develop skills that will serve them as they move beyond the walls of ASIJ and into the world. The program embodies our core values and allows students to discover who they are, explore their passions, and grow as individuals. ASIJ is a school where the coder on one of our robotics teams is also a Varsity athlete. The kind of school where you can play on the football team and in the jazz ensemble. The kind of school where you can make a difference through meaningful, hands-on service opportunities. The kind of school where prowess on the field, in the dojo, and on the stage go hand in hand with academic success. Weâre the kind of school that recognizes you can learn from defeat, from winning, and from being part of a team. The kind of school where you arenât locked in a predefined track, but rather can explore new interests when that spark occurs. Athletics During the school year, high school teams compete in 15 sports against other schools in 250 matches through our participation in the Kanto Plain League and various tournaments with other international and Japanese schools. We aim to involve as many students as we can on Varsity, JV, and JV B teams wherever possible while still providing a competitive experience. Students participate as athletes, team managers, game/event support personnel, student athletic trainers, and student coaches. In middle school, we offer 20 sportsâsome at a competitive level and others just for fun. In elementary school, after-school sports activities range from swim and basketball to soccer and tennis. We also offer two unique sports programs that span across all divisions at the Chofu-campus, Shotokan karate, and kendo. At the ELC, after-school activities include karate and gymnastics. We have partnered with the Positive Coaching Alliance (PCA) to help our student-athletes become âBetter Athletes, Better Peopleâ. PCA focuses on teaching young adults that winning is important but it is more important to honor the game and those who participate in it. 20 Elementary School Teams Over 30 High School Teams 26 Middle School Teams 8 Elementary Arts Programs Arts From hula dancing at the ELC, ballet in the elementary school, to traditional Japanese theater in our middle and high school, there is certainly no shortage of opportunities for students to shine in the arts. Each division at Chofu stages a musical every year with additional opportunities to act, write, direct, edit and pursue stage crafts in the high schoolâs fall play and one act plays, the middle school movie, ASIJ TV and movie production club in high school. Qualifying students also have opportunities to join the Kanto Plain honor band, choir or orchestra, and AMIS music program. In high school students have the opportunity to engage in debate and speech competitions to further hone their aptitude and interest in public speaking. 30 Arts Activities Over 190 Students involved in Musicals Service Groups such as our Model UN, Amnesty International and 25 service projects offer our students challenging ways to learn and contribute to society as well as engage in and support social justice and respond to environmental issues. Through activities such as rice project in the elementary school, our middle schoolers teaching English to Japanese students in Tohoku, or a yearly Habitat for Humanity trip, students learn to understand and respect diverse perspectives, and are empowered to make a difference to their world. Over 600 Service Group Members 25 Service Projects 7,000 Riceballs made in Elementary School 7 VEX Robotics Teams STEM Whether itâs organizing a Space Conference with speakers from NASA and JAXA, competing in a VEX Robotics tournament or getting started with cardboard engineering, opportunities to explore STEM abound at ASIJ. Our younger students begin with simple coding and hands-on activities and progress to middle school where they start programming apps and building robots. Our annual VEX Tournament provides middle and high school teams the chance to compete against their peers while the Computer Science Club allows students to develop higher level skills. In high school, iGEM provides a challenging program that synthesizes multiple skills and see students collaborate to solve a problem using bioengineering. Also our high school and middle school students compete in North East Asian Mathematics competitions and International Academic Competitions. 16 STEM Activities Over 45 Kanto Plain Championships in 2019 Life at ASIJ Our Community Our Buses Our Year Activities, Arts, & Athletics Safeguarding at ASIJ Early Learning Center 6-16-5 Roppongi, Minato-ku Tokyo, 106-0032 (+81) 03-5771-4344 Chofu Campus 1-1-1 Nomizu, Chofu-shi Tokyo 182-0031 (+81) 0422-34-5300 Portals The Gate The Workroom Alumni Portal Summer Programs Summer Passport Summer Day Camp Quick Links Contact Admissions Give to ASIJ Alumni Employment Publications ASIJ Stories Data Protection Policy Sitemap"

See More ASIJ Stories â Additional Links About ASIJ / Alumni / Visit / Partner with ASIJ / ASIJ Stories / Sitemap Parent Engagement Engaging with the Future of Education Our Partnerships Our Parent Partnership initiatives reflect our attention to the challenges our current generation of Mustangs are facingâfrom those children now at the ELC through our seniors who are nearing their graduation. ASIJ has been The American School in Japan for over 100 years, and our ability to remain relevant over time is grounded in our willingness to negotiate the challenges of each generation. Our longevity speaks to the schoolâs reputation for excellence, stability, and capacity to continuously evolve our programs in response to what students need. We now turn our attention to the challenges our current generation of Mustangs are facing, and invite parents to a variety of presentations, workshops, and town halls. These events address the future of education at ASIJ, challenges our students face, and questions of our parent community. ASIJ 2030 Series What does the future of education look like at ASIJ, and how are we preparing our students to thrive in uncertain times? Our ASIJ 2030 Series is designed to build understanding of our Strategic Design Framework, how ASIJâs Nâ12 Portrait of a Learner redefines rigor, and what this reimagined vision of learning looks like in practice across our divisions. ASIJâs Strategic Design Framework (SDF) was created in 2018 and refined to its current iteration in 2021. ASIJâs SDF has been meticulously researched, aligned to emerging research on how students learn as well as the skills and competencies their future employers need, and calibrated carefully against trends in college admissions. Among the major influences on ASIJâs SDF is Michael Fullan , who writes, âIf we want learners who can thrive in a turbulent, complex times, apply thinking to new situations, and change the world, we must reimagine learning: whatâs important to be learned, how learning is fostered, where learning happens, and how we can measure it. This means creating environments that challenge, provoke, stimulate, and celebrate learningâ (2018). The ASIJ 2030 Series includes virtual interactions with recognized thought leaders on the changing landscape of education. It includes facilitated conversations with ASIJâs faculty and school leaders on the strategies we are designing to evolve our own systems and programs and helps parents of students of all ages understand our priorities, the pace of change at ASIJ over the next few years, and how the ASIJ experience in the future should look different from today. â Know, Value, Care Partners Series What challenges and threats are ASIJ students facing today, and how can we work together to help our children and adolescents navigate these challenges? The Know, Value, Care Partners Series emerges from ASIJâs Commitment to Know, Value, and Care (KVC) and is designed to strengthen our home-school partnership. This series of events focus on a variety of topics from Parenting in a Digital Age to addressing substance abuse and social-emotional wellness. â ASIJâs obligation to its students does not end with their academic studies and admission to college. The pandemic has disrupted life as we knew it, creating an altogether different reality for our children that is complicated by a confluence of other pressures and uncertainties. Anxiety levels among children and adolescents are rising at alarming levels. Ubiquitous access to technology makes our lives better in many ways, but far more complicated in myriad other ways. Helping children or adolescents navigate social media and balance their technology use is an enormous challenge for most parents. Further, while students experience many of the same adolescent decisions their parents once faced (e.g. alcohol, cigarettes/vaping, drugs), these dangers, too, have evolved. The Know, Value, Care Partners Series includes workshops, presentations, book studies, and other discussions designed to help parents unpack the complex challenges their children may be experiencing. We will not always have the answers. We hope to engage parents in a meaningful partnership where every child who attends ASIJ is known, valued, and cared for, which includes protecting them from harm. â Mustang Connections What questions or concerns do parents presently have and how can division leaders and faculty help parents understand how to support their children at home? Finally, beyond our ASIJ 2030 Series and our KVC Partners Series, we know parents have division-specific questions grounded in the present day! In an effort to ensure a dialogue with parents about issues they want to understand, we offer routinely-scheduled virtual town halls by division. We will call this series of events Mustang Connections. Mustang Connections provides routine interactions between parents and the leaders, counselors, and others who work in your childrenâs divisions. Our aim with these interactions is to ensure meaningful two-way conversations, which help parents support their children with practical or logistical matters, as well as discussions about division-specific programs and needs.

They are the type of students who come to school everyday ready and eager to learn, but who also enjoy being challenged and have many interests outside of school. â âThird Grade Teacher A Foundation for Success We recognize the importance of the early years as a foundation for later success. As a learning community that supports students from age five up, we recognize the importance of the early years as a foundation for later success. We focus on the development of early literacy and numeracy skills and build on that success from year to year. Elementary school children are in the process of developing enduring attitudes about themselves and their world. We help them to develop pride that comes from a variety of accomplishments, a sense of joy in learning that comes from meaningful, rich experiences and a growing ability to be responsible for themselves and others. How we run ASIJ is a place where learnersÂ  are able to take chances, are excited to learn and where youâll find a community that is warm and caring. We believe ASIJ offers one of the strongest developmentally-appropriate academic programs available to young students anywhere in the world. The Elementary School operates on a nine-day cycle. Each school day is designated by a letter, A through I, independent of the day of the week. Physical education, visual arts and music classes meet three times per cycle, and there are daily Japanese language classes for heritage speakers and as a foreign language. Students also have regularly scheduled class time in our age-appropriate library, which they can also access during recess. A full complement of specialists provide support to children with a range of learning needs and three counselors support studentâs social and emotional well-being. Further services are provided by learning support teachers, ELL specialists and a speech language therapist who works with students in Kindergarten through grade five. More detail about our approach and curriculum at each grade level can be found in our Learning Framework. The use of iPads for learning is a key component of our instructional program in elementary school. iPads are used for learning in ways that enrich experiences, personalize instruction, and extend our capacity to connect and contribute to the world. Students use iPads to inquire, collaborate, create artifacts which represent their learning, and share their learning. Our digital citizenship program focuses on building studentsâ skills so they know how to engage online in a safe, honest, responsible, and respectful manner. We believe that well-managed, balanced and purposeful use of technology can help us become a community of inquisitive learners and independent thinkers.

The middle school years are a journey through early adolescence where intellectual, social and physical changes are rapid and varied, so our faculty deliver a program aimed to meet these needs for the different grade level groups, while keeping a close eye on molding and shaping each individual student as well. Our ultimate goals are to stretch and develop students to their maximum potential, and to also equip them with the critical socio-emotional, academic, and behavioral skills to flourish in high school and beyond. We are committed to offering a well-rounded, student-centered, and hands-on academic and co-curricular program, ensuring a memorable learning experience for your child. Growing in Middle School In the middle years, students experience a great deal of growth and the brain both sprouts new dendrites and prunes those that are not used. This makes it particularly important that we give students opportunities not just in humanities, science and math but also in performance, language, creativity and design. We provide a curriculum that allows for guided choice, covering a broad range of subjects and topics so the brain can flex and grow at this vital time. Students may find that some subjects come naturally and that others require persistence and perseveranceâ practice with our Approaches to Learning allows students to demonstrate good learning habits that are manifest in collaboration, responsibility and self directed learning. More detail about our approach and curriculum at each grade level can be found in our Learning Framework. To see how well our students perform in reading and math on MAP tests, take a look at the Annual Report. The Middle School year is divided into two semesters. The timetable operates on a rotating block schedule whereby Humanities classes meet everyday and all other courses meet alternate days for 75 or 80 minutes. Middle schoolers have Advisory period every day for 35 minutes. During the year students explore unique settings in the mountains, lake regions, cities and coastlines of Japan through our extended campus program. Through this classroom-without-walls concept, our trips provide students with memorable experiences that make the curriculum come alive through each trip's diverse activities. Students develop stronger bonds and friendships because of these trips, both with their classmates and their teacher chaperons and, of course, have a lot of fun while they learn.

Itâs amazing. âHigh School Senior Beyond Grades Students are encouraged to look beyond grades as they pursue learning through a wide variety of authentic experiences, both in and out of the classroom. In high school teachers and students share the responsibility for active learning and our faculty engage students in an atmosphere which promotes inquiry and intellectual risk-taking. Students are encouraged to look beyond grades as they pursue learning through a wide variety of authentic experiences, both in and out of the classroom. In order to help students balance and navigate the complexities of such experiences, we have developed a seminar program. This allows students and their personal and academic counselors to discuss topics that are relevant to student life such as time management, responsible use of social media and healthy relationships. In addition, counselors provide emotional support to students through the ups and downs that may naturally occur as they aim for their personal and academic goals. The Details Four years (eight semesters) of high school attendance and 22 credits are required for an ASIJ diploma. More details about these requirements and our curriculum can be found in the High School Learning Framework . ASIJ offers a wide range of Advanced Placement (AP) courses, including the AP Capstone Diploma, an innovative program designed by the College Board that allows students to engage in the rigorous development of inquiry, research, collaboration, and writing skills. The AP Diploma program is meant to complement the in-depth,subject-specific rigor of AP courses and exams. Students who take AP exams may earn advanced academic credit and/or standing in college and these high-level courses that are recognized internationally by universities. Independent research consistently shows that AP students are better prepared for college than students who donât take AP. To see how our students perform academically, take a look at the Annual Report and High School Academic Profile. Students may also take courses through the Syracuse University Project Advance (SUPA) program, a concurrent enrollment program linking the university with secondary school, and Global Online Academy (GOA). GOA is aÂ  consortium of the top independent schools from around the world and as a member school, ASIJ students can enroll in courses as diverse as The Graphic Novel or Medical Problem Solving. Working closely with peers and teachers from around the world, ASIJ students have an exciting and flexible online learning opportunity that will challenge them to further develop cultural competence and global citizenship skills. Students who would like specialized learning options beyond ASIJâs in-house course offerings may choose to enroll in a one-semester or year-long online course through GOAâs broad and rigorous selection of online courses. ASIJâs IMPACT program provides a personalized learning framework designed to empower students with skills for self-efficacy and a passion for learning that transcends school. The possibilities are diverse and driven by studentsâ interest in becoming self-guided, lifelong learners.The program consists of four components: Design for IMPACT, IMPACT Seminar, IMPACT Network and a Presentation of Learning. A successful IMPACT experience will provide a foundation for students as they continue to chart their path towards university, summer opportunities, internships, and other opportunities to pursue their future goals. Students who elect to participate in the full IMPACT program receive a certificate of distinction.

Read More â Watch Video Advancing International Relations While many people in many different jobs handle challenging logistics, complex schedules, and international travel arrangements, the stakes are somewhat higher when your role is Advance Coordinator at the White House and you're supporting the work of the President of the United States. âI work in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and when I go into work my day revolves around what the President's schedule is going to look like over the next few days, weeks, and months,â says Kai McGuire â14. âAdvance is a weird word when you think about it, because it can be a noun or a verb or an adjective depending on the context in which you use it. In this case we use it in a verb form â advancing a âprincipal,â advancing a person â so in my case, Iâm advancing the president,â Kai explains. âEvery time the President leaves the 18 acres of the White House, thereâs a group of people who go out ahead of him, anywhere from seven to 10 days, that are from the Secret Service, White House Communications, White House Military Office, Press Advance, Staff Advance, and the Medical Office,â former Presidential Advance Director Kelly Gannon Russell explained in a 2022 interview. âThey would all go out and handle all the logistics for all the Presidentâs movements, but also all the staff that travel with him and security, and the media. Theyâre the people who have to make the trip possible for the principal.â âWe have to understand where the principal is going to be walking, where are they going to enter a building? If they're making a speech, what sort of stage are they going to be standing on? What is the backdrop going to be? What kind of people are they going to be interacting with? Is it open press? Is it closed press?... Is it going to be political? Is it going to be in the principal's official capacity? There are a lot of different questions that have to be answered,â Kai says. In addition to planning the specifics of each trip or activity ahead of time, the advance team also accompanies the principal on their visits. Coordinating current and future logistics, moving team members around the country â and often the world â requires a lot of planning. âA lot of my day revolves around looking at the schedule and understanding what our needs are based on the specifics and the peculiarities of the trip itself. That involves the logistics of getting travel, getting our advance team to these locations, and making sure that they have the tools that they need to do the job,â Kai says. Beyond that, Kai considers âwhat is the cadence of what we're going to be doing? How many people do we need to be sending out?â He describes the work as being like an air traffic controller. âWe have many different trips going on, we have different advance teams, and we need to circulate and allocate our resources to all of these different trips. And a lot of times they're very complicated because they involve different stops along the way.â Kai's yearbook photo from the 2014 Chochin In addition to the planning, there is also the execution of the trips, and the other main part of Kaiâs work involves accompanying the President when he travels. It was in that capacity that Kai recently had the opportunity to return to Japan, the place he grew up, as a member of the team attending the G7 Summit in Hiroshima. âThat was a really meaningful experience for me because it was a homecoming in many ways,â he says. âI was really proud to be back at home and able to represent the administration and the important work that we were doing there. It felt really meaningful and just a great opportunity to connect my different worlds â different parts of my upbringing.â Kai spent many of his formative years in Tokyo, attending ASIJ from 2005 until he graduated with the Class of â14. His family have strong connections to the school with his younger brothers Ian â17, Hugh â20, and Lee â22 all fellow Mustangs. Kaiâs father Matt McGuire (AP â05â22) also served on the schoolâs Board of Directors for three years. âMy mother is Japanese and my father is American, and growing up in Tokyo and going to ASIJ, I think was always very aware of the fact that the United States and Japan share this very special relationship, this very special alliance, which in many ways, you could say I am sort of a direct product of.â Kai particularly remembers the impact that his education and the trips he took at ASIJ had on his understanding of that context. He particularly remembers trips to Kiyosato Educational Experiment Project (KEEP) and Izu in middle school as well as taking Japan Seminar (JSEM) with Kathy Krauth (AP â00â12) in high school. âThat was a really important class for me, a really formative experience,â he says. The class provided him the opportunity to really understand and peel back the layers of the country he grew up in. âI think it was that experience of understanding the United States and Japan's history, and the history of the relationship, and getting a better, deeper understanding of the work that it takes to create a relationship like that that really, really inspired me.â Kathy remembers Kai as a stellar social studies student, who excelled in JSEM. âHe was curious, intelligent and was able to make meaningful connections across time and space,â she told us. âHe was, and I am sure remains, a kind and funny person.â Kai was voted \"best smile\" in the senior superlatives in the 2014 Chochin Opportunities to travel and explore his own cultural background âteach you how much you actually don't know about the world. And it always made me very curious,â he says. âI think what's sort of really sparked my interest in trying to understand more about the parts of the world that I had never been to or that I hadn't encountered yet in my life.â That influenced Kaiâs choice to study international relations, firstly at Tufts where he majored in International Relations, Russian and European Studies, and currently at Georgetown Universityâs Walsh School of Foreign Service where he is a McHenry Fellow pursuing a masterâs in Asian Studies. It was also âwhat inspired me to study abroad when I was in college twice, first in the Republic of Georgia and then in Russia,â he says. âI think that the service trips, the field trips [at ASIJ] were all really formative experiences because they really get you out of the bubble of Tokyo and get you out into Japan, meeting people who you wouldn't normally interact with,â he reflects. âAnd I always remember coming away from those trips and feeling like, oh, there's so much of the world I just don't know.â Kai boarding Air Force One through his work as an Advance Coordinator for the White House Kai was able to leverage his international background and language skills early in his career working for the Embassy of Japan in the United States for two years as a Congressional Coordinator. He later joined McLarty Associates, an international strategic advisory firm that specializes in commercial diplomacy. There, Kai managed a global client portfolio focused on the firmâs work in Northeast Asia and Japan. He then moved to the White House, beginning his time in the administration as an advance associate in 2022. âI always felt a very strong call to public service â I think since I was young, I knew I wanted to be in public service and that everything I studied and did in my work was going to be toward that.â Kai credits much of his perspective and success to his experience at ASIJ. âBeing the beneficiary of such a robust educational program, being around such great faculty, being in such a really loving community, and having great friends, I felt really fortunate to grow up in that environment.â He goes on to reference the phrase âto whom much is given, much is requiredâ in the context of his desire to give back. Â âI feel very fortunate to have had an education at a school that really impresses upon students the value of being a global citizen,â he says. âI really just felt a call to live up to that principle and to try to make use of my education â the education that I feel so fortunate to have received â and I felt really compelled to pay that forward in some small way.â â See what we've been up to.

Read More â Watch Video A Place of Pride On November 16, 2017 ASIJ hosted the head of Shibuya ward governmentâs Gender Equality and Diversity Promotion Division, Ryutaro Nagata. Although his title is focused on Gender Equality and Diversity Promotion, Ryutaro has a special interest in awareness and equality for sexual minorities and members of the LGBTQ community, placing him in a unique position to work with the Queer Equality Alliance (QEA) high school club along with the Japan Center. High school senior Sara Hoskins writes on his visit. During his visit, Mr Nagata presented to high school students in the ASIJ Theater and shared his story of how he led efforts to promote the understanding of sexual minorities at Gap Japan, where he previously worked. His presentation continued as he spoke to what his role is now in the new Gender Equality and Diversity Promotion Division and finally provided insight on what kind of stigma remains as well as what positive changes have come about in regards to LGBTQ issues in Japan. In addition to his high school address, Mr Nagata spoke more personally to QEA members and other interested students in an informational lunch session. He not only enlightened the theater full of high school students on current issues, his own personal achievements and hopes for the future in terms of LGBTQ issues, but he also touched those he met in the ASIJ community. Many students reported feeling inspired by his words and bubbly disposition. One student shared that she had known a lot about LGBTQ issues in America, but that Mr Nagata âhelped [her] to understand more about the LGBTQ community in Japan.â When speaking about the lunch meeting, students also mentioned enjoying that it was very informational and personalâspecifically stating that âhe shared his own experience coming out and living as a gay man in Japan and how it shaped his lifeâ. ASIJâs high school Queer Equality Alliance (QEA) addresses LGBTQ issues, focusing on social issues and the steps they can take to promote understanding, tolerance and respect at ASIJ, locally and globally. Some of the clubâs activities include the Day of Silence, Ally Week and Coming Out Day. Mr Nagata was part of QEAâs ongoing speaker series. The club is grateful for the efforts of the Japan Center to facilitate Mr Nagataâs participation at ASIJ. See what we've been up to. Watch Video See what weâve been up to.

Read More â Watch Video Space Club Serena Landers â20 and Marine Savoure â21 explore the lessons learned by NASA engineer Bobak Ferdowsi â97 throughout his life and career during his visit to ASIJ â âWhy do we exist? Why is earth so full of life? A lot of the work that we do at NASA and the work in particular that I'm working on now is to help us understand what's going on in our own planet.â This is what drives Bobak Ferdowsi â97 in his work at NASAâs Jet Propulsion Lab as a systems engineer. Ferdowsi, who spoke at ASIJâs Space Conference in May 2019, was just 24 when he first started working on NASAâsCuriosity Rover mission to Mars. Nine years later, the rover successfully landed on the Red Planet. For Ferdowsi, the beauty of his work lies in its potential to âhelp humanity create solutions that address the problems and the challenges of our times.â Ferdowsi finds that space exploration puts things into perspective: âit helps us realize that there is so much more between shared between us than there are differences.â Though Ferdowsi now sees his purpose clearly, he didnât grow up aiming to be an engineer. At most, his interest in space consisted of a fascination for science fiction. âI grew upon science fiction,â he says. âIt planted a couple of seeds.âIt was only in high school that Ferdowsi became seriously interested in science, inspired by his chemistry teacher,Mr Chambers (FF â89â11. By conveying his excitement and interest in science, Chambers showed Ferdowsi that âthis is something that is worth being excited about.â Ultimately, Ferdowsi realized that âscience was a place that I really want to pursueâ, though the road ahead would still have twists and turns. Initially majoring in physics, Ferdowsi soon realized that this wasnât quite right for him. Marine and Serena interviewing Bobak for the article Despite having âexperimentally made a mistake,â Ferdowsi highlights what he learned from it: âWhat I did enjoy from that experience was I really liked trying to figure out how to solve a problem, building up some hardware to then address that issue.â This, alongside a recent successfulNASA rover mission to Mars, led him to go into aerospace engineering, where his trial and error approach to life would continue to serve him. Ever since his bicycling accidents as a child, from which he learned to inflate his tires and wear a helmet, Ferdowsi has seen failure as a learning experience. âThere will always be failures, but how we address those and how we learn from them is really how we keep getting better and better a tour jobs or our lives.â In high-risk environments like NASA, it becomes especially important to learn from failure. The question, Ferdowsi states, is âHow do you make mistakes on Earth before you launch people into space. How can I fail when it doesn't cost me something, versus fail when something important is on the line?â As an engineer, failure represents a crucial part of Ferdowsiâs job. He admits that testing failure on earth and adapting to failure in space are his favorite parts of the project. âIt's this awesome opportunity to play detective.â Ferdowsi has now played âdetectiveâ on multiple NASA missions. He previously worked on the Curiosity Rover mission, which aimed to determine whether there is or has been life on Mars. It was a groundbreaking mission, using new techniques and processes for landing and holding avast array of scientific instruments designed to probe the Red Planet. Now, heâs preparing for another launch, currentlyâfinishing the design, where we're building hardware, where we're delivering software,â in preparation for the goal of launching in January 2022. In parallel, his team is also working with India, âdelivering the spacecraft hardware to India and integrating with the Indian spacecraft.â Though Ferdowsi tends to prefer the hands-on testing to the mission-planning discussions and spacecraft design process, every step is important. He highlights that this is why a variety of individuals with differing strengths and interests is a necessity at NASA. From lawyers to artists, and accountants to storytellers, there are many professions within the team: âI think all of that comes together,â he says.The collaboration between all the moving parts âmakes the whole thing work very well.â Ferdowsi believes âweâve sort of moved past the point of where youâre going to have that lone, great scientist or engineer,â and that âthe next generation of discoveries and advances are going to come as a result of people working together.â When working with many individuals, âthe ability to understand different perspectives and to bring different perspectives to the table is extremely valuable.â Ferdowsi gives the example of the discussion between scientists and engineers between the desire to conduct as many experiments as possibleâversus whatâs safe for the spacecraft from an engineering perspective.â âConsensus-buildingâ, as he calls it, is vital on all levels in order to integrate multiple points of view into a single solution that works for everyone. B obak and fellow guest presenters pose for a photo with Space Club members Having this open mindset and ability to navigate different viewpoints is becoming increasingly important as the space community moves âtowards more international collaboration,âFerdowsi notes that his current project in collaboration withIndia was fulfilling and âa very, very different experience than working just within NASA.â He believes that his time at ASIJ helped foster his multiculturalist and collaborative mindset. He notes that learning in the ASIJ environment, where there are many perspectives and beliefs, challenged him to understand othersâ frameworks: âI think you learn to consensus-build naturally here at ASIJ.â Now Ferdowsi is giving back to his community. In May of2019, Ferdowsi returned to ASIJ to speak at the second annualSpace Conference. Organized by the students of the HighSchool Space Club, the conference had many ASIJ students, parents and faculty in attendance, as well as students from several other schools. This Space Conference was generously funded by current parent Ted Tawara and the PTA, which sponsored Ferdowsiâs visit to ASIJ. Sakiko Miyazaki â20, head leader of the Space Club and organization team for the conference, says that âas the Space Club, our mission is to spread our passion for space exploration throughout the community. With the Space Club Conference, we aim to show students the boundless opportunities space holds.â Ferdowsi spoke on the importance of a positive mindset towards failure, encouraging students to follow their interests and not be deterred by failure. âIt was so inspirational to see a former ASIJ studentâs journey in pursuing his passion for space,â says Miyazaki. Just like Mr Chamberâs approach to science inspired Ferdowsi, perhaps one of the members in the audience has been in turn inspired by Ferdowsiâs passion. A new wave of future change-makers and space explorers is on its way. See what we've been up to. Watch Video See what weâve been up to.

Read More â Watch Video The 2021 Daruma on the printing press at Murooka Printing Rolling Off The Press Steve Dornbach (FF â09ââ12) reflects on 50 years of Daruma, ASIJâs literary magazine. âTime is a sort of river of passing events and strong is its current; no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place.â The Roman Emperor and philosopher, Marcus Aurelius may have been speaking about time and the passing of our lives, but his words certainly ring true when talking about the ASIJ student literary and art magazine, Daruma. Daruma turned 50 years old this past spring. This was the latest edition recognizing ASIJ student creativity and expression through writing, artwork, poetry and prose. The magazine has captured five decades of creative pursuits providing insights into the lives, hopes, dreams, thoughts, feelings and passions of generations of ASIJ students. After 50 years, Daruma has become, as student and Daruma staff member Sena Chang â24 says, âa treasured relic of ASIJ.â Each school year, a team of typically about a dozen students, along with a faculty advisor, solicit work from their peers in the form of poetry, short stories, photography and artwork. The purpose is to give students an opportunity for creative expression outside of the classroom. The process starts, as last yearâs Daruma staff said, âthe moment a student decides to put their confusions, their questions, or their emotions into color, language, and formâ and it continues when they choose to submit and share their work. Max Duncan (FF â19â21) celebrates another successful publication with the 2021 Daruma team The student editorial staff then curates the submissions that best capture the âconfusing, enigmatic and immaterial,â the expression of the ASIJ studentâs lived experiences. And the product, (the magazine itself) has evolved into a time capsule of sorts. As the quote by Marcus Aurelius states, âa river of passing eventsâ that âprovide insight into the perspectives of the contemporary student body through the curation of an enduring published product.â TIME â from 2nd to 12th grade A unique example of time, and how Daruma reflects the experiences of ASIJ students throughout, is on display in a section of this springâs 50th edition. Several of last yearâs seniors had an opportunity while in grade 2 to write haikus about âtime.â They wrote about how landscapes change over time, wanting time to move faster so they can get outside to recess and the memorable clock kits they used to learn to tell time. Many of these 2nd grade haikus were included in the 40th edition of the magazine, as that milestone provided a chance for a âTimeâ retrospective, and some of these students went on to be Daruma staff members in high school. Last spring they had the chance to meet again to reflect on time and discuss some of those shared 2nd grade memories. And though some of the students had not necessarily been close friends over the past decade, student Ina Aram â21 realized they âknow each other in a uniquely intimate and distant way â we hold memories of each other from age seven, at seventeen.â And those memories are shared through their experiences and reflected in Daruma. 10 years on from 2nd grade and they can see how they âare intimately and unexpectedly a part of each otherâs stories,â how their lives ârun parallel to those of the people around us,â and how the lives and experiences of ASIJ students âare spurred by the lines of poetry and pencil drawings circa 2011.â The common thread where all of these experiences intersect? On the pages of Daruma. Previous Daruma advisors connected over a Zoom call Whether looking at an issue from this past spring, to an issue 15 years ago or even going back as far as 30 years, the photos, the poems, the stories all thread a common needle. ASIJ students can find a familiarity on the pages of Daruma relating to the experiences of identity, what we call home and finding our place in the world, to working out and connecting our past to reflect the realities of our present. There can also be found in the pieces a longing from students to understand how our pasts and presents might inspire our futures. Time has been the constant thread that any ASIJ student could relate to or could see reflected in any issue of Daruma. THE TROUBLE WITH TIME As magical, as reflective and as connecting as time can be, time does not come without its faults. Last year as Karen Noll (AP â03â21), former faculty advisor and current librarian, along with Daruma staff members, browsed and digitized 50 years worth of student work, they realized that there were some pieces that simply didnât âage well.â Though time gives us a unique and refreshing perspective, as reflected by last yearâs seniors, it can also reveal some truths about our pasts. Max Duncan (FF â19â21), the faculty advisor for the past few years, commented that time posed a challenge in that âlast yearâs staff struggled a bit with reconciling the past with the present. The reality that some issues, some language and topics donât âwear wellâ into the present day. Some language that was common in the â70s or â80s just may not be considered appropriate or acceptable today. The benefit of hindsight allows us to see that now.â Duncan posed the question: âWhat will Daruma staff 50 years from now say about our language and representation (or lack thereof?) today? Only time will tell.â This was an issue much discussed, grappled with and considered throughout the year and there was consensus amongst the staff that though the magazineâs purpose is to provide a forum for student experiences, we must look at these pieces within the context of when they were written and try to understand and learn from that. â MUROOKA PRINTING AND ASIJ Two things have remained constant for Daruma over time. One is the support the administration and the school has given to the arts through this student publication. ASIJ must be lauded for supporting the written and visual artistic life of its students for 50 years! There have certainly always been yearbooks, and those serve a wonderful purpose of capturing the day to day, the events and the accomplishments from one year to the next. But an artistic magazine like Daruma, captures the thoughts, hopes, fears, ambitions, confusions, anxieties and truths that students experience while growing up. To support an advisor and the costs associated with printing a magazine each year, for 50 years, demonstrates a multi-generational commitment to their students and the arts. June Kushida (FF â72â75; â82â03) with members of the 1984 Daruma team The other constant is the unique relationship the magazine has had with a local publisher, Murooka Printing. Eriko Murooka and her father Hikoe Murooka have printed Daruma for the past 30 years. They are a local, family owned printer and when I took over as advisor from Wally Ingebritson (FF â86â09), his one admonition to me was âUse Murooka Printing!â Iâm sure the printing work could be outsourced at a lower cost, but Wallyâs was a sage piece of wisdom in that through the 30 year partnership with Murooka Printing, they have developed an understanding of the role Daruma plays in the life of the school, for the lives of its students, and how that can be best represented on the printed page. Mary Onions (FF â96â16) poses with members of the 2004 Daruma team â CLOSING To quote faculty advisor Max Duncan again, âTime has been an ever present member of the Daruma staff and artistic representation year in and year out. Though advisors and students come and go, the lived experiences of ASIJ students at school, in Tokyo and greater Japan remain constant. And these experiences are borne out in the words and images that are curated each year in the magazine.â Last spring, former advisors to Daruma, including June Kushida (advisor â74ââ75; â84-â02), Mary Onions (advisor â04), Wally Ingebritson (advisor â05ââ09), myself, Steve Dornbach (advisor â10ââ12) and Karen Noll, met for a trans-Pacific and trans- Atlantic Zoom call to share reflections and stories about Daruma. Just as the 2nd graders turned 12th graders met and quickly felt the connection they had through the work represented on the pages of Daruma, so too, did we as advisors. We quickly fell into easy conversation, reminiscing mostly about our students, their commitment to the sharing of ideas, to making sense of their lives and representing that, for their classmates, on the printed page. It was clear that each advisor carried with them during their tenure, the weight of that responsibility and the desire for the magazine to be the best representation of studentsâ lived experiences as possible. Bari (Karlin) Douglas â98 To read Daruma is to get a glimpse into the common and shared lives and experiences of 50 years of ASIJ students. Sena Chang â24 said it best at the conclusion of an article from this past spring, describing how Daruma links one generation of ASIJ student with the next, when she says âThrough its power to refine our cultural, familial, and personal identities, the pages of Daruma transcend generations, possessing an immortal soul that you, dear reader, are a part of at this very moment.â June Kushida (FF â72â75; â82â03) with members of the 1997 Daruma team And student Nathaniel DuBois â21, wrote a lovely piece titled âA Trek Through Timeâ for the 50th edition that deftly encapsulates the concept of time and the connection students have been describing for generations. It is a written piece that creates a walk through the experience of each grade level while weaving in a poem that connects each stanza along the way. The poem portion of is work reads: âThe journey starts with a single step. One foot in front of the next. The ground may be hard. The path may not be set. We may meet others. They may help; they may not. But they too trek as we do. We all walk along. Ahead lies our own future. Beneath lies our life. Yet weâre drawn back to the path weâve already traveled. The connection we create with people. The moments we share with others. The feelings we experience together. Foundation is found in the past. Look back on the short trail I trekked and try to find my footprints. Maybe youâll see something I donât.â See what we've been up to. Watch Video See what weâve been up to.

We ask everyone in our community to help. Current parents, alumni, alumni parents, current and former faculty and staff, corporations and friends. ASIJ needs and wants everyone in its community to be a supporter of our school. + Can I donate any amount? Yes, of course!

If you donate in US dollars at every.org/asij , you can also opt into monthly donations and sustain your impact. + Are gifts tax deductible? In Japan, ASIJ has a special dispensation status ( tokuzo ) that allows us to issue tax receipts for yen gifts of Â¥2,000.

We handle this personal information with the utmost care. We ask all parents, alumni, employees, and other users of ASIJ services to read and agree to the ASIJ data privacy policy.Â We abide by the best practices and principles laid out in the Amended Act on the Protection of Personal Information (Personal Information Protection Commission, Japan) and any other applicable laws, regulations, or guidelines. Collection and retention of personal information ASIJ collects, stores, manages and processes a wide variety of personal information. This includes information about children. We collect information from prospective employees and students during application processes. We collect personal information from alumni and donors, and from organizations who work with ASIJ or who employ our community members. This information is collected electronically and on paper forms, and stored in various electronic databases. We retain information on our students and their families, our alumni and employees for as long as it is relevant for the purposes of school operations. We delete information that is unneeded (such as data stored about former prospective students or their families) after three years. Any time we begin collecting personal information from a new data subject, we will seek consent from the identifiable person or their guardian. â Utilization of personal information Personal information is information relating to a living individual containing a name, date of birth, or other descriptions recorded in a document or electromagnetic record. The personal information we collect is used to operate the school and provide related services. We use information about student learning to make decisions that help each child reach their potential. We use the email addresses of our community members to send targeted messages conveying important information. We store and use the phone numbers of ASIJ parents and their emergency contacts to ensure that students are kept safe. We store a large amount of personal information and we use it with care in ways that align with our core values: we treat your information with character, courage and compassion. Provision of personal information ASIJ shares your personal information only in ways that you would expect. We transmit information between databases so that personal information is kept up to date in a variety of systems with only a single point of entry. Those systems hold data on our behalf. We share report cards and transcripts with other institutions when requested to do so in ways that help our students transition to other schools or universities. We share appropriate and accurate personal information with trusted adults, such as teachers, bus drivers, trip chaperones, medical professionals, and coaches in order to conduct school operations and ensure safety.Â Access to special care personal information , such as racial or ethnic group membership data or medical history records, (as defined in Article 2.3 of the Amended Act on the Protection of Personal Information) is restricted to the appropriate employees. By default, employees only have the most basic access to personal information databases. Higher levels of access are granted only as necessary.Â Trusted adults who are not employees of the school, such as trip chaperones, coaches, or parent volunteers, may be given access to personal information on an as-needed basis. These trusted adults will be required to agree to the current ASIJ data usage procedures.Â Personal information is not transmitted, revealed, or disclosed to third parties except in cases where information is urgently required to protect the life, physical body, or possessions of another person and in cases specified by Article 23, Section 1 of the Personal Information Protection Law of Japan. ASIJ will never sell your personal information. Technical safety management of personal information ASIJ takes necessary and appropriate measures for security control of personal data. ASIJ uses encryption technology known as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) on pages where users enter their personal information. SSL encrypts and authenticates information transmitted between the browser and the web server, preventing the theft or alteration of data by a third party. ASIJ uses best practices in network security, including enforcement of strong passwords. We provide specific training to prevent targeted cyber attacks. We abide by our legal obligations to report any data breach to the affected data subject(s) and the Personal Privacy Commission.

What brings all these adults together? A Mobile Community Itâs the last day of school and as each of the thirty one buses slowly navigates the driveway there are cheers, applause, tears and laughter. Whether its your last day at ASIJ or just the start of your summer break, itâs an emotional event for everyone and one that highlights the important place our buses play in our studentsâ lives. Each bus is its own mobile community, each of the 276 bus stops the starting place of friendshipsâfor students and adults alike. Every day almost 1,300 riders board a bus to come to school, cared for by their well-trained bus monitors who make sure they are safe. Each rider taps on and off the bus with their ID so their parents can track them through the BusMinder app on their phone. Safety is paramount but should anything go wrong along the way, our 170 bus monitors are prepared and each certified in CPR and basic First Aid. All buses are also equipped with GPS tracking systems, two-way radios, iPhones, and first aid and emergency supplies. â At the end of the day, our younger students can take a bus home when school ends. Those in after-school activities can stay and take one of the later afternoon buses that align with our co-curricular programs. â The Bigger Picture Our videos below offer additional insights into how our buses work for our community. A Bus Parent Story Why Do Our Parents Like the Bus? A Bus Rider Story Our Riders Love the Bus, Too! A Bus Monitor Story Hear from a Bus Monitor Weâ¤ï¸ the Bus Convenient, Enjoyable, Reliable, Safe ASIJ transportation is convenient, reliable, and safe. Over 1000 students in kindergarten through grade 12 enjoy their bus ride to and from school each day. ASIJâs Bus Fleet ASIJâs fleet includes 33 well-appointed buses. Students ride in climate-controlled comfort in upholstered seats, complete with seat belts. All buses are equipped with GPS tracking systems, two-way radios, iPhones, and first aid and emergency supplies. Bus Stops For the convenience of ASIJ families, buses serve neighborhoods throughout downtown Tokyo. Most bus stops are located within a few minutesâ walk from familiesâ homes. Parents Riding the Buses Parents of bus riders are welcome to ride the bus to and from ASIJ for school events, activities, and volunteering, etc. There is no charge for this service. Sometimes the best school for your child isnât always next door. Our journey often begins on the bus, but our destination is impactful learning and everything that Japanâs largest international school campus offers. Simply putâweâre worth the ride.

Consequently, tuition and fees would be significantly higher were it not for contributions and other non-tuition income. Therefore, your continued support of the School's voluntary annual fund is earnestly requested.Â  For more information on how to make your contribution, please see Support ASIJ .

See More ASIJ Stories â Additional Links About ASIJ / Alumni / Visit / Partner with ASIJ / ASIJ Stories / Sitemap Admissions FAQs Weâre sure youâve got questions. We have the answers. â Inquire/Apply Continue Application âð½ + What time does the school day start and end? Classes at the Chofu campus begin at 8am and conclude at 3pm. Throughout the year, we offer a variety of co-curricular activities that end at varying times. Classes at the Early Learning Center Begin at 8:30am and conclude at 2:30pm. + Do you have a boarding or homestay option? No, we are a day school and require students to be living with their parent/guardian in Tokyo during their enrollment at ASIJ. + Do you have to be a US citizen to apply? No, there are no citizenship requirements to apply. + Do you admit students with special learning needs? We have a learning support program Kâ12 that supports students with mild learning needs. Each applicant is reviewed individually to evaluate whether we can support their learning needs within our curriculum. We encourage prospective families to contact our admissions office to discuss their particular situation. + Do you have to be a native English speaker to attend school at ASIJ? No. English is our language of instruction, and we have students with a variety of language backgrounds. A high level of English proficiency is needed to be successful in our program, but we offer a language support program in grades 1â8 to support multiple language learners. + Do graduates attend only American universities and colleges? While the largest percentage of our students choose to attend university or college in the United States, many others attend schools in Canada, the UK, Australia and Japan. For more details, please check our Annual Report . + What is the difference between International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) and the Advanced Placement (AP) curriculum offered at ASIJ? If we compare the AP to IBDP, then here are the major differences: AP courses can be taken independently of each other and there is no unifying component that connects them together. AP does not limit the number of exams a student can take. Students at ASIJ may sit for AP exams that reflect courses they are currently enrolled in, with the exception of AP Chinese, AP Japanese, or AP Spanish exams. The IBDP is limited to six courses â first language, additional language, math, science, social studies, art (with some variation). IBDP students choose three at Higher Level and three at Standard Level, taken simultaneously. AP courses are rigorous, in-depth and focused on a single subject area. The IBDP focuses not just on specific subject content but also on competencies such as global awareness. AP courses are one year whereas IBDP courses are two years. AP courses culminate in a single final exam (with some exceptions for art) that consist of multiple choice/essay questions whereas IBDP courses include coursework as part of the experience along with final exams that consist of several papers. The IBDP includes core components of theory of knowledge (TOK), creativity, activity, service (CAS) and a 4,000 word extended essay. If students are not taking the full diploma, but just exams in particular subjects, then they are not required to complete these. The AP Capstone Diploma allows students to engage in the rigorous development of inquiry, research, collaboration, and writing skills. The program is meant to complement the in-depth, subject-specific rigor of AP courses and exams. The program consists of a two-course sequence: AP Seminar and AP Research. Students planning to take the AP Research course must have completed AP Seminar and scored 3 or higher. Students who score a 3 or higher in the AP Seminar, AP Research, and at least four other AP courses during high school will receive the AP Capstone Diploma. AP scores are 1â5 and IB scores are 1â7 in individual subjects, and combined into an overall total of up to 45 points. + How many different nationalities attend your school? We have over 50 nationalities represented within our student body. American families make up about half of our student body and are keen to continue to diversify our representation. Close to half of our families are bi-cultural with parents from the US and Japan. For more details, please check our Annual Report . + Do you get many new students each year? Yes, our new enrollment typically fluctuates between 15-20% annually. We have new students in all grade levels each year. + Where do your teachers come from? We recruit worldwide in order to hire the most talented teachers in the world. While the majority of our teachers are from North America, we also have teachers from the UK, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Europe, and South America. + Can I donate to ASIJ during the Admissions application process? While ASIJ is most appreciative of philanthropic support from friends, the school does not accept gifts from prospective families who are not otherwise affiliated with the school during the Admissions process. This ensures that the focus remains on ASIJâs prospective students and their strengths as candidates for admittance.

Endowment Contributions to the endowment give the school administrators and the board of directors flexibility and confidence to grow, improve as strategic developments and initiatives change to reflect the world with which ASIJ is Shaping Tomorrowâs Leaders Today. Establishing a named endowed fund will further ASIJâs legacy of support for our faculty and students. Your gift is a transformational statement of your philanthropic giving and your belief in the mission of ASIJ. General Endowment â â This permanently restricted endowment was established in 2022.

Four Reds Fund Takakuni Go Fund The Equinox Fund Student Financial Assistance Endowment â Joseph E DeMarsh Scholarship Faculty and Staff Support Endowment â Ray Downs Faculty Fund The Board of Directors and the Finance Committee have a fiduciary obligation to oversee the investment of the schoolâs endowment assets and to maximize the financial return on those resources, taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for the school.

Planned Giving Gifts for which you plan for future contributions to support the mission of ASIJ. The easiest and most used planned giving tool is leaving a charitable gift in your estate plans. There are several ways that you can define the amount of your charitable gift to the American School in Japan. Planned giving can include: A gift of a particular amount of money. For example, you give $25,000. A gift of a specific item or items. For example, you give 1,000 shares of ABC Corporation. A gift that will be made only if one or more conditions are met. For example, you give $25,000 provided we still offer a particular program or service and your spouse does not survive you. A gift that will be made from the remainder of your estate once all other bequests, debts, and taxes have been paid. For example, you give 25% of the remainder of your estate. Often called a \"residuary bequest,\" this approach assures that your family will be taken care of before your estate makes a bequest to us. To discuss giving opportunities with ASIJ, please reach out to the advancement team via email or phone, advancement@asij.ac.jp. I know of no better way to prepare for the future than by leaving a legacy to ASIJ today. â Ken Glazier â67 The Gate Society Anderson, Irene â74 & Somes, James Bergt, Dave â60 & Jeannine Cohen, Frederick â69 Cooper, Peter & Pamela Dennis, Thurman Downs, Vicky â¡Downs, Ray â50 Forgrieve, Bruce â77 Glazier, Kenneth â67 Harada, Mary â81 â¡Harris, Frederick â¡Haven, Robert Hesselink, Ann â71 â¡Hoffsommer, Abigail â27 â¡Hoffsommer, Walter â29 Huddle, James â70 Jones-Morton, Pamela (PhD) Ludlow-Ortner, Julia â72 & Ortner, Robert Muhl, Dick Nichols, Kerry & Lynn â¡Nicodemus, David â33 Proctor, David Shibata, Hideko â66 â¡Snyder, Ronald â¡Sullivan, John Sundberg, Carl â77 Suzuki, Chizu â64 Tunis, Jeffrey Ware, Brent â74 â¡ Deceased Annual Giving Endowment Planned Giving Give Now Early Learning Center 6-16-5 Roppongi, Minato-ku Tokyo, 106-0032 (+81) 03-5771-4344 Chofu Campus 1-1-1 Nomizu, Chofu-shi Tokyo 182-0031 (+81) 0422-34-5300 Portals The Gate The Workroom Alumni Portal Summer Programs Summer Passport Summer Day Camp Quick Links Contact Admissions Give to ASIJ Alumni Employment Publications ASIJ Stories Data Protection Policy Sitemap"

More KIST Graduates Around the World Founders' vision 日本語 It is with great pleasure that we welcome you to the K. International School Tokyo website! We hope you find it useful in learning more about our school and the services we provide. As the founders of KIST, we are often asked why we decided to start an international school. Looking back, the first time it occurred to us was when we heard a young boy from Africa, crying from distress at being teased. It broke our hearts to hear his words: “Why is the color of my skin different? Why aren’t I Japanese?” It was from these beginnings that the seeds of thought began to form in our minds. In the past, enrolling at an international school in Tokyo was for a privileged few. Due to various reasons, children who wanted to attend an international school, couldn’t, and were instead forced to attend regular schools where they were met with painful experiences and teased because of differences associated with their culture, language, race and way of thinking. After coming to this realization, we felt that it was unfair and illogical and so we wanted to do something to help these children. This is why we established K. International School Tokyo. \"Over the years, we have come to the realization that simply providing a safe environment for students from various backgrounds is not enough.\" Our original vision for the establishment of KIST was to provide a quality, holistic international education for children from diverse backgrounds and abilities to study together in a safe and secure environment without prejudice or injustice. Over the years, however, we have come to the realization that simply providing a safe environment for students from various backgrounds is not enough. One day, a student from a less-privileged country came to us in tears to express his concerns about his future: \"If my father loses his job in the future, I'll have to support my family. In order to do this, I need to get into a good university in order to get a good job. If I can't get a good job, I'll have to return to my home country. But there are no good job opportunities back home so I won't be able to support my family.\" We were deeply moved and shocked by his words and felt that we needed to provide a learning environment where students could develop high level skills and acquire knowledge to enable them to achieve their goals, regardless of the nationality or the financial status of their families. Even students without abundant financial resources can study at top universities by receiving tuition exemptions through scholarships based on high scores. For this reason, we decided to change the direction of the school to focus on academics, and to raise our academic expectations in order to enable students to achieve high scores that open doors to as wide a range of university options as possible. As a result of various reforms and initiatives introduced since April 2011, KIST has been the highest ranking school offering the DP in Japan for several consecutive years. \"We decided to change the direction of the school to focus on academics, and to raise our academic expectations in order to enable students to achieve high scores that open doors to as wide a range of university options as possible.\" Our curriculum, as based on programs developed by the International Baccalaureate, provides a great opportunity for children to inquire about the world in which we live. But it is not for everyone. Being a student at KIST is demanding and requires an effort by the students themselves and an enormous amount of support from their parents. As a private school, we are able to select children who will benefit the most from the education we provide. But this does not mean we only choose students who are gifted. We value students who are academically motivated and have their own goals for the future. We value students who are serious about learning and always strive to do their best. We value students who are caring and respectful and exert a positive influence on their peers. We value students who are active rather than passive learners with a passion to find out more about the world. And we value students who want to make the world a better place. It is tremendously gratifying to see these children grow as they progress through our school. \"We value students who are caring and respectful and exert a positive influence on their peers.\" As our school population continues to increase, we are excited about the many possibilities that are yet to come. Our dream of creating a place where internationally minded children can grow and develop into altruistic human beings has only just begun. Thank you for taking the time to visit our website.

More KIST Graduates Around the World Guiding statements 日本語 Mission K. International School Tokyo provides academically motivated children from diverse cultural and social backgrounds with a high-quality education in a safe and supportive environment in order to develop competent , academic individuals with high moral character who make meaningful contributions to our global community. Revised October 2023 Vision K. International School Tokyo seeks for all learners to demonstrate excellence in academics, compassion for others, and a commitment to making the world a better, more peaceful place. Revised October 2018 Guiding beliefs K. International School Tokyo believes that: Being a member of the school community requires a belief in and a commitment to uphold the school's mission and vision as well as a dedication to its guiding beliefs. A high-quality education is defined as promoting academic excellence, international understanding, moral character and lifelong learning. A safe and supportive environment is one which encourages respect, responsibility, tolerance and compassion. Individuals with high moral character are defined as being those who are kind, caring and compassionate; honest and principled; respectful and responsible; well behaved and well mannered; who follow established rules; show an awareness of others around them; and demonstrate a commitment to the wellbeing of others. Education is a shared partnership of mutual cooperation between students, parents/caregivers and the school. Cultural diversity enhances our school community as well as our understanding of the world. Central to being internationally minded is recognizing that diverse, rich cultures exist in all regions of the world, and demonstrating a tolerance for the varied beliefs and traditions of these cultures. The language, customs, traditions and cultural beliefs of our host country, Japan, serve as an important resource in enriching the learning experience. A regularly reviewed, comprehensive international curriculum that is linked across the school, is essential in preparing students for their future lives. Being a global citizen requires knowledge and skills in the use of technology; however, the ability to function independently and act promptly in the real world also requires core knowledge and skills independent of technology. Special emphasis should be placed on the development of skills in language and mathematics as essential learning tools. Setting high academic expectations supports the development of strong academic skills which increase the chances for future academic success. Students learning through a second language require more learning time and a greater degree of effort and support than those learning through their first language. Native language development and maintenance is important in developing identity, self-esteem and cognitive ability, and ultimately contributes to academic success. Maintaining a safe and collaborative learning environment free from bullying and harassment requires the support of the school community as a whole in taking appropriate action when necessary. Reinforcing appropriate dress and behavior standards promotes a respectful, responsible and safe school environment. The accessibility of educational opportunities at the school is dependent on the establishment and sustainment of systems that take financial needs into consideration as well as on the maintenance of economical and efficient fiscal management. Revised October 2023 Educational goals To enable all students to acquire at a high level the knowledge and skills required by the DP in order to contribute to and succeed in our global community. To open the doors to leading universities for all students who wish to continue receiving a high-quality education after graduating from KIST. To support students with financial needs in receiving university scholarships that are offered to those with outstanding academic results. Through a cooperative partnership with students' families, to nurture individuals with high moral character who contribute positively to society in their interactions with others throughout their lives.

More KIST Graduates Around the World About KIST 日本語 K. International School Tokyo (KIST), founded in 1997, is a private, co-educational, non-denominational day school serving the international community of Tokyo from pre-Kindergarten to Grade 12. Conveniently located less than one minute from Kiyosumi-Shirakawa Station in Koto-ku, Tokyo, KIST offers an affordable international education to more than 630 students representing around 50 different nationalities. In order to prepare students for their adult life, KIST strives to create a safe and caring environment set firmly within a framework that promotes academic excellence through traditional values, a disciplined approach and a healthy lifestyle. The three guiding principles of Respect , Responsibility and Safety overarch all aspects of school life. All students are required to abide by the school dress code by wearing the school uniform and maintaining a conservative appearance throughout their enrolment. They are also expected to act in appropriate ways that uphold the name of the school. KIST students possess high academic aspirations and the desire to continue “Learning for Life” after they graduate. They also demonstrate their compassion by acting on their desire to help others in need and believe that such actions can make the world a better place. As an international school, KIST welcomes students of all nationalities from “internationally minded” families who can demonstrate a commitment to our vision, mission, educational philosophy and learning programs. The current student population includes approximately 25% American/Canadian/Australasia, 22% Japanese, 15% UK/European, 15% Indian, 12% other Asian and 11% African/Middle Eastern/South American students. Specifically, KIST caters for: Non-Japanese children whose families are living in Japan. Children of dual nationalities. Returnee Japanese children or those whose families are planning to live in an English-speaking culture. Children of all nationalities planning to attend international universities, colleges or other institutions of higher education in the future. Authorized as an IB World School by the International Baccalaureate, KIST was the first school in Tokyo and the second school in Japan to offer all three IB programmes: the Primary Years Programme (PYP), the Middle Years Programme (MYP) and the Diploma Programme (DP). This ensures a consistent approach to teaching and learning across all levels and provides a continuous progression for students from the time they join the school in kindergarten until they graduate at the end of Grade 12. Furthermore, for families moving around the world, it also offers an attractive benefit in that it allows children to learn within a basic framework used by other IB schools worldwide. \"We had a great experience in Tokyo.  The Experience of K. International was particularly enriching.  We were privileged to have our son study at your school.\" (Former Grade 3 Parent, India) At all levels, an inquiry-based approach provides students with opportunities to take responsibility for their own learning. Subject areas are integrated where possible into units of inquiry that allow students to acquire knowledge and skills through the context of an ongoing search for meaning and understanding. Priority is placed on developing understanding of concepts and application of knowledge and skills in context. We explicitly teach the skills of understanding, research and inquiry, including how to locate, evaluate and apply information. Through this approach, our aim is for students to become independent learners who have the skills to source and evaluate information in order to make informed, responsible choices throughout their lives and to make a meaningful contribution to the community. English is used as the language of instruction at all levels of the school, however, English is not taught as a foreign language. With the exception of very young children, students must have reached a certain level in English already in order to enter the school. In particular, secondary students must have a high level of ability in order to cope with the demands of studying specialized subjects in English. To meet the needs of non-native English-speaking students whose level of English is lower than is necessary to access the school curriculum independently, language support is provided throughout the school. The type of support provided varies depending on the grade level of the students. It is important to remember that KIST is not an English conversation school. In addition to the regular curriculum, students at KIST enjoy a variety of co-curricular activities including a range of after-school sporting and cultural clubs, excursions, school concerts and festivals, camps and more.

More KIST Graduates Around the World Accreditations and affiliations 日本語 HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION Choosing a school that is right for your child is one of the most important decisions a parent can make. There is a large variety of international education options in Tokyo, each with different objectives and programs. Researching and selecting a school with quality programming in which your child will thrive can be a significant challenge. At KIST, we are committed to delivering education of the highest standard and to the continual development and refinement of our educational programs. The quality of our programming is assured through school accreditation and/or authorization by external organizations. While affiliation with such organizations mandates staff involvement in professional development, KIST also supports staff involvement in continuously reflecting on, and improving, their practice through professional opportunities provided by other membership organizations we belong to and through a comprehensive teacher appraisal system implemented annually. KIST has attained accreditation and/or authorization by the following organizations: The Council of International Schools (CIS) is a large membership community of over 1,000 educational institutions in more than 100 countries.

Our highly qualified and committed teaching staff represent over 15 different cultural backgrounds and bring with them a wide range of skills and experiences. Currently, our staff numbers approximately 60 teachers across all grade levels from Kindergarten through Grade 12. This includes Elementary School classroom teachers, Secondary School subject teachers and various other single subject teachers who work across different areas of the school. Our teachers are enthusiastic, motivating, caring individuals who are committed to achieving the goals identified by our school's guiding statements . All teachers at KIST are required to be certified teachers with a recognized teaching degree (e.g. Bachelor of Education or equivalent thereof). In addition, they must have either a minimum of two years' teaching experience or be graduates of the IB Diploma Programme. All staff undergo rigorous evaluation before being offered a position at the school. After joining our school community, they undergo an annual Teacher Performance Review that covers all areas of teaching, learning, classroom organization and management. Due to the nature of international education, the turnover of staff changes from year to year. In general, our teachers are employed for an initial two-year period. Some teachers decide to leave at the end of this period; however, many extend their time with us for a second or third period. \"KIST is a school that embodies the spirit of inquiry and fosters an academic freedom for both students and faculty not found in most schools. In this sense, KIST is intellectually refreshing and a vibrant place for learning.\" (Secondary School teacher, USA) As part of our commitment to providing a high quality education, our staff participate in regular professional development activities that assist them to develop and update their teaching skills. This professional development takes a number of forms including attendance at IB workshops and conferences held in countries around the world, attendance at other recognized professional development designed for teachers, school-based workshops where specialist presenters come to work with our teachers on relevant topics, professional reading opportunities, peer classroom visits and exchanges with other schools. We encourage our staff to continually reflect on their teaching and learning at both a classroom and school level. Participation in professional development by our teachers also acts as a model to our students in encouraging them to become lifelong learners. 日本語 ©2020 K.

More KIST Graduates Around the World Learning spaces 日本語 In August 2006, KIST relocated to its current campus at Shirakawa in Koto-ku. The site, formerly owned by the Koto-ku government, was purchased by our school founders as part of their dream to expand the school facilities and services. Prior to KIST, the site was occupied by the former Shirakawa Elementary School which operated from 1950 until its closure and amalgamation with Meiji Elementary School in 2002. Before taking over the site, the exisiting buildings (Main Building, Gymnasium) were inspected for earthquake resistance and the presence of asbestos. To meet strict regulations governing school buildings, various renovations were completed before we moved in. In addition, all bathrooms were upgraded with western-style toilets and all classrooms were fitted with air conditioning. Interior walls were also given a fresh coat of paint thanks to the cooperation of KIST students and their families as well as staff. In November 2008, construction of the West Building was commenced as part of an extensive school redevelopment project. The 4-storied building, which opened in August 2009 in time for the start of the 2009 - 2010 school year, contains general classrooms, specialist classrooms for art and music, the Junior Library and a multipurpose room. The main school entrance, incorporating the school reception counter, is also part of this building. Current learning spaces include: General and specialist classrooms Science laboratories Computer laboratories Libraries (Junior Library, Main Library) Gymnasium Multipurpose room Outdoor facilities consist of a large communal playground, a rooftop area and a separate play area for K1 to K3 students. The communal playground is used by both elementary and secondary students and consists of a playing field covered with high quality artificial turf, and an undercover and deck area with tables and chairs. During recess times students have access to a range of sporting equipment and developmentally appropriate learning experiences. Many of our sporting clubs and teams also use this area for their after school and weekend practices. The rooftop area is an open area available to all departments of the school. It is used for a wide range of activities including drama and music practice and sport as well as a general recreation space during recess times. The ECE playground, for K1 to K3 students, focuses on a wide range of developmentally appropriate outdoor experiences for children from three to six years old. This space is viewed as an extension of the indoor learning environment and is planned for as such. It includes experiences for gross and fine motor development as well as dramatic play and construction. To increase opportunities for students to participate in a variety of sporting activities, students also visit off-campus sporting facilities such as athletics stadiums, sports grounds and swimming pools. 日本語 ©2020 K.

KISTival , the annual school festival, is the largest and most important fundraising activity held during the school year. Several thousand visitors pass through the gate each year into a fantastic world of witches, ghosts, Halloween pumpkins and a host of other amazing characters. Visitors enjoy a range of multicultural foods at the world food court as well as shops and bazaars, a games arcade; live entertainment with performances by students, staff, parents and special guests; and the always popular grand raffle with amazing prizes, in addition to activities such as face painting and nail art. A costume competition is also held and prizes are awarded in various categories. Money raised from KISTival is put toward the purchase of learning materials that benefit all students in the school such as library resources, computers; art and science supplies, musical instruments pr sporting equipment, or it is put towards specific projects aimed at improving the general learning environment or school facilities. Because of this, the entire school community works very hard to ensure the festival's success in order to raise as much money as possible. For this reason, to ensure that all families contribute as equally as possible, participation is compulsory for all families through assistance with pre-festival preparations and on-the-day attendance and booth support. In fairness to all families, those unable to assist prior to or on the day of the festival are asked to make a monetary donation in lieu of participation. The festival is open to all families and friends of KIST as well as members of the general public. A small admission fee is charged to cover the cost of garbage disposal on the day. KISTival trivia! The name \"KISTival\" was introduced in 2010. Prior to this, the event was referred to simply as the \"School Festival\" (with the exception of 2009 when it was called \"K. Festa\"). A school festival has been held every year since the school's founding. In 2017, however, a special event called \"K.20 Celebration\" was held in place of KISTival to commemorate the school's 20th anniversary. 2018 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011 | 2010 | 2009 Bazaar Face and nail painting Food and drinks View from above 日本語 ©2020 K.

To allow for maximum participation and effective use of the main school playground, the day is divided into three sections: K1 through Grade 1 students and families participate from early morning, Grades 2 through 5 from late morning, and Grades 6 through 12 from the afternoon.

More KIST Graduates Around the World Exhibitions 日本語 The PYP Exhibition In the final year of the Primary Years Programme (PYP), all students participate in the PYP exhibition. This represents a significant event in the life of a PYP school community. The exhibition project requires that each student demonstrates engagement with the five essential elements of the programme: knowledge, concepts, skills, attitudes and action. The inquiry, which encompasses a variety of subject domains, is conducted in the spirit of personal and shared responsibility culminating into a summative assessment activity. It is an opportunity for students to exhibit the attributes of the learner profile that have been developing throughout their engagement with the PYP. We look on the exhibition to celebrate the student's learning before moving from the PYP into the Middle Years Programme (MYP). The PYP exhibition has a number of key purposes including the following: For students to engage in an in-depth, collaborative inquiry. To provide students with an opportunity to demonstrate independence and responsibility for their own learning. To provide students with an opportunity to explore multiple perspectives. For students to synthesize and apply their learning of previous years, and to reflect on their journey through the PYP. To provide an authentic process for assessing student understanding. To demonstrate how students can take action as a result of their learning. To unite the students, teachers, parents and other members of the school community in a collaborative experience that incorporates the essential elements of the PYP. To celebrate the transition of learners from primary to middle/secondary education. As the culminating PYP experience, it is required that the exhibition reflects all the major features of the programme. Therefore, it must include regular and carefully planned assessment. © International Baccalaureate Organization 2007 At KIST, the PYP exhibition takes place towards the end of Grade 5. The exhibition unit is developed under the transdisciplinary theme: How we organize ourselves. Students are required to engage in a collaborative, inquiry process that involves them in identifying, investigating and offering solutions to real-life issues or problems. The conceptual understanding for the inquiry selected must be of sufficient scope and significance to warrant a detailed investigation by all students. Issues investigated in previous years have included global warming, discrimination, racism, pollution, healthy lifestyles and so on. The event is held in the evening to allow full parent participation so that students are able to present their findings to their families and other visitors. The MYP Personal Project Exhibition The MYP Personal Project Exhibition is held during the winter term. It provides an opportunity for students in Grade 10 to present their research findings as part of their Personal Project, the culminating experience for the Middle Years Programme. On the day of the exhibition, students set up individual booths where they can introduce their topic to parents and other visitors. 日本語 ©2020 K.

More KIST Graduates Around the World Japanese celebrations 日本語 In recognition of the importance our host nation, Japan, plays in the life of our school, a number of traditional Japanese events are celebrated during the year. New Year Party Japanese New Year (oshogatsu) is celebrated toward the end of January and provides an opportunity to welcome the new year while introducing aspects of Japanese culture to students and parents. This includes opportunities for students to participate in traditional new year activities such as mochitsuki (rice cake pounding) and also to interact with local sumo wrestlers who visit the school on the day to participate in mock bouts with students. Even our youngest students enjoy trying to push the sumos outside the ring. Setsubun Setsubun, the bean throwing festival, is celebrated on February 2. At KIST, it is enjoyed by students from K1 to K3 who gather to sing a song together in Japanese and learn the special phrases: ‘Oni-wa soto’ (out with demons) and ‘Fuku-wa uchi’ (in with luck). After this, the students receive a visit from some colorful demons! They try to eradicate the demons by performing an action called mamemaki (bean throwing). They throw beans at the demons while repeating the phrase ‘Oni-wa soto’. At the same time, they throw beans inside the room and say ‘Fuku-wa uchi’. Finally, it’s time to eat some of the beans. Traditionally, it is the custom to eat the same number of beans as your age in the hopes of having a longer life. Hinamatsuri Hinamatsuri, the Japanese Doll Festival or Girls’ Day, is celebrated on March 3. Beautiful ornamental dolls representing the Japanese Emperor, Empress, court attendants and musicians dressed in traditional clothing worn during the Heian period are displayed on stepped platforms covered with bright red cloth. At KIST, the doll display is set up in the foyer of the West Building toward the end of February for students to enjoy as they pass through this area. 日本語 ©2020 K.

More KIST Graduates Around the World School song 日本語 play pause stop min volume max volume ForTomorrow.mp3 In June 2012, our school song \"For Tomorrow\" was presented to the school community for the first time at our annual end-of-year concert. Featuring an easy-to-sing, memorable melody, the song was composed especially for us by renowned Japanese musician and guitarist, Tomoyasu Hotei. Unlike many typical school songs, which tend to focus on being a source for creating school pride or for glorifying a school's merits, the idea behind \"For Tomorrow\" was to create something more meaningful that describes the type of individuals we hope our students will become. To capture the essence of this concept, the lyrics we developed for the song reflect our mission and vision in conveying the message that we should never forget that we are the ones who shape tomorrow. Just as we are supported by people around us, we must also ensure that we in turn help others. If we support others, or are in some way able to help build a brighter future for those around us, we can take pride in our own lives. To improve the ongoing state of turmoil in the world, we need talented, caring individuals with a sense of responsibility. It is our hope at KIST to nurture competent, academic young people with high moral character who, through mutual cooperation, can contribute to society by striving to build a better world, not only for themselves and the current generation, but also for future generations. This is the concept behind \"For Tomorrow.\" We hope that the song endures as a source of inspiration for all the members of our school community, and will be cherished for years to come. There are two versions of the song - a sing-along version (featured in the recording on this page) and a full version with additional lyrics (as shown below) We hope you enjoy listening to our school song, \"For Tomorrow.\" For Tomorrow (Full version) Never forget that all through time We make the future together Side by side, hand in hand Building a better world for tomorrow We are all sharing the earth We're not alone Neighbors and friends helping us learn All through our lives Any time you see someone who is in need Just stop and think what help you can give Just trust in yourself, believe in yourself And you can change the world For everyone どんなときも　わすれないで (Donna toki-mo wasurenai-de) 未来は皆で　作ってくよ (Mirai-wa minna-de tsukutteku-yo) 輝く未来　 築くために (Kagayaku mirai kizuku tame-ni) 明日に向かい　歩こうよ (Ashita-ni mukai aruko-yo) 人や自然に　ささえられ (Hito-ya shizen-ni sasaerare) 私たちは　生きてる (Watashitachi-wa ikiteru) いつの日か　誰かのために (Itsu-no hi-ka dareka-no tame-ni) 何かができるかな (Nanika-ga dekiru-kana) 誇りをもち　生きてくために (Hokori-o mochi ikiteku tame-ni) さあ未来へ (Saa mirai-e) For everyone Join together, helping each other The future's not ours alone, it's everyone's Sharing our hopes and dreams, for a bright future Making a better place for tomorrow But there are mountains in life That we must climb But if you try you will find You can shine Anytime you see someone who is in need Just stop and think what help you can give Just trust in yourself, believe in yourself And you can change the world いつの日か　誰かのために (Itsu-no hi-ka dareka-no tame-ni) 何かができるかな (Nanika-ga dekiru-kana) 誇りをもち　生きてくために (Hokori-o mochi ikiteku tame-ni) さあ未来へ (Saa mirai-e) For everyone © Copyright 2012 All Rights Reserved Music: Tomoyasu Hotei Lyrics: Craig Larsen (English), Komaki Family (Japanese) Unauthorized copying, lending, public performance or broadcasting of this recording is prohibited. 日本語 ©2020 K.

This bridge was the starting point of Basho's travels in 1689 and a bronze statue of him is located at its southern end. Several other monuments to Basho's life and times including a memorial park and a small shrine can also be found around the area. Tomioka Hachimangu Shrine Located approximately three minutes from Monzen-Nakacho Station to the south of KIST, Tomioka Hachimangu Shrine was originally built in 1627 but has been rebuilt several times due to fires. During the Edo Period, sumo tournaments were held regularly at the shrine. Although tournaments are no longer held, the shrine is still widely known by sumo enthusiasts who visit it to view a monument known as the \"Yokozuna Stone\" in which the names of champions are etched. Every three years, a major festival, the Fukagawa Hachiman Festival, is held at the shrine. The festival is one of the three largest festivals in Tokyo and attracts around 500,000 spectators. One of the special features of the festival is a parade of \"mikoshi\" (portable shrines). 日本語 ©2020 K.

Our Teaching and Learning policy makes explicit the school expectations with regards to the roles of each stakeholder group in supporting learning. view our Teaching and Learning Policy here With regards to our curricular programming, upon evaluating various curricula from around the world, KIST chose to adopt the world-renowned International Baccalaureate’s Primary Years Programme (K1 to Grade 5), Middle Years Programme (Grades 6 to 10) and Diploma Programme (Grades 11 and 12) as the most appropriate curriculum frameworks for our school. These IB programs focus on the total growth of the child, affecting hearts, as well as minds and addressing social, physical, emotional and cultural needs in addition to academic welfare. KIST believes that the inquiry-based approach to education provides students with the opportunity to take responsibility for their own learning. Class inquiries may take the form of: E xploring, wondering and questioning . E xperimenting and playing with possibilities . R esearching and seeking information . C ollecting data and reporting findings . C larifying existing ideas and reappraising events . D eepening understanding through the application of a concept or rule . M aking and testing theories . M aking predictions and acting purposefully to see what happens . E laborating on solutions to problems . Through this approach we aim to guide students in developing problem solving skills and research skills that will allow them to not only cope with a rapidly changing world, but help them to become lifelong learners and productive members of our global community. Overarching all three IB programmes is the learner profile which is defined by a list of behaviors that the programmes intend to develop in all children in all school cultures. The learner profile encourages children to be: Attributes Examples Attributes Examples Inquirers - Being curious about the world - Asking questions - Showing enthusiasm for learning Principled - Taking turns - Completing tasks on time - Being honest and fair - Doing the right thing Thinkers - S olving problems - Considering ideas - Finding creative solutions Caring - Showing respect - Being positive - Helping others Communicators - Sharing ideas - Listening to others - Helping others understand - Using different languages Open-minded - Being open to new experiences - Accepting differences - Appreciating others Risk takers - Always having a go - Being brave - Trying new things Balanced - Spending time doing many different things - Balancing study, exercise, fun and relaxation Knowledgeable - Learning about the world - Knowing different things - Connecting facts Reflective - Knowing strengths and areas to improve - Thinking about own learning Curriculum explanation sessions are scheduled throughout the year for families to learn more about the nature of the curriculum, the learning methods focused on and other general expectations. All parents/guardians are encouraged to attend these sessions in order to gain the knowledge necessary to be able to provide appropriate support to their children. \"Study after study has shown that students who participate in IB programmes are better prepared academically for university-level courses, and are more likely to graduate (and graduate sooner) than other students. This year, more than one million IB students worldwide will have participated in the Diploma Programme. IB programmes, develop the intellectual rigour and personal, emotional and social skills students need to live, learn and work in a rapidly globalizing world.\" IB Higher Education Symposium, International Baccalaureate Organisation, 2015 日本語 ©2020 K.

More KIST Graduates Around the World Primary Years Programme (PYP) 日本語 The Primary Years Programme (PYP) provides a comprehensive, inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning. The curriculum framework focuses on the total growth of the developing child, touching hearts as well as minds and encompassing social, physical, emotional and cultural needs in addition to academic welfare. At the center of the PYP curriculum are five essential elements: knowledge, concepts, skills, attitudes and action. These five elements are used as the basis for all planning and teaching. The school’s program acknowledges the importance of subject areas such as: language; mathematics; social studies; the arts; science and technology; and personal, social and physical education. In order to help students, make meaningful connections, these subjects are integrated wherever possible into units of inquiry. By providing students with this approach, the program aims to further the acquisition of knowledge and skills in the context of an ongoing search for meaning and understanding. Students from K3 to Grade 5 are engaged in six inquiry units a year that are centered around themes of global importance: Who We Are; How We Organize Ourselves; Where We Are in Place and Time; How the World Works; How We Express Ourselves; and Sharing the Planet. In K1 and K2 (3 to 5 years), four inquiry units are explored each year from the above themes. Towards the end of the PYP, students are involved in a culminating experience, the PYP Exhibition , in which Grade 5 students plan and present a collaborative project to the school community to demonstrate what they have learned during their years in the PYP. Alongside the mainstream academic areas, the school offers a broad range of subjects to challenge and stimulate students’ interests. Single subject teachers work with classroom teachers to ensure quality instruction in a range of subject areas. As a school, we believe that this integrated approach to learning provides students with the opportunity to acquire skills in context, and to explore content that is relevant to children and transcends the boundaries of individual subjects. For more information about the PYP, please contact the PYP Coordinator. IB Documents PYP Sample Programme of Inquiry 日本語 ©2020 K.

We aim to provide a welcoming and supportive environment that encourages students to engage with the wider world and develop skills that will equip them for life. Our professional library staff, facilities and resource selection (both physical and electronic) aim to enhance student learning and inquiry, and provide resources to support the teaching of the IB curriculum. The school has two library facilities catering to each area of the school: Elementary and Secondary. In 2011, both of these spaces and their resources were upgraded. In particular, the school invested in a major renovation and extension of the former Secondary Library, resulting in its re-branding as the LMC (Library Media Center). The collections in both libraries are continually being developed to support the curriculum and recreational needs of students and staff.  KIST libraries currently hold approximately 25,000 items catalogued and accessible online using the Destiny library software system. Most titles are in English, however, the libraries also support a commitment to mother tongue languages with the provision of many Japanese titles and a growing collection in other languages spoken by our students and staff. Both libraries are available for use by all members of the school community for research and recreation, including parents. Library Media Center (LMC) Located on the second floor of the Main Building, the LMC is available for students in the Secondary School studying within the Middle Years Programme (MYP) from Grades 6 through 10 and those in the Diploma Programme (DP) in Grades 11 and 12. The LMC includes a spacious casual reading area, an independent study area and two quiet rooms for DP students. The collection includes non-fiction books, a selection of reference titles, journals/magazines, and an up-to-date, quality fiction selection to stimulate a love of reading. Teachers have access to professional research and support materials and audiovisual resources to use in the classroom. Laptop computers are available for students to search the resources held in the library, subscribed online resources and the Internet. A projector and screen are available for class instruction. All Secondary students are free to visit the LMC during recess, lunchtime and after school. Classes held in the library focus on the development of critical skills. The teacher-librarian works closely with faculty staff to design and implement an information literacy program which teaches students the skills they need for in-depth, critical research and independent study. The librarian manages the LMC and its resources, and supports students in their studies. Books! Study area Elementary Library The Elementary Library, which can be found on the third floor of the West Building, caters to all of our PYP (Primary Years Programme) students from K1 through Grade 5. The collection includes materials to support the PYP, with many non-fiction and reference titles, and an excellent collection of picture books and chapter books from multiple perspectives to encourage literacy and inquiry learning. Teachers can access big books, posters and charts, audiovisual material and professional research books relating to the PYP. Desktop computers are available for students to search the library catalogue and access online resources. The Elementary School Librarian plans activities with teachers and encourages good reading habits in our younger students.

More KIST Graduates Around the World Academic performance 日本語 KIST offers two IB programs (PYP and DP) with curriculum content tailored for success in the culminating Diploma Programme. All students in Grades 11 and 12 at KIST study in the Diploma Programme. For each graduating class since our inception, the KIST DP average score has been well above the DP world average score. The statistics for DP performance at KIST from the past 5 years are shown in the table below. Students in the IB Diploma Programme study 6 subjects and can attain a maximum of 7 points in each subject. Three additional points may be attained from completing the core Diploma required assessment components of Extended Essay and Theory of Knowledge course. Candidates can thereby attain a maximum score of 45 points in the Diploma Programme. *Globally, statistical averages indicate that less than 50% of students take the full DP with approximately 80% of those students attaining the IB Diploma . 日本語 DP Exam Results DP Course Average Results IGCSE Course Average Results ISA PSAT KIST is very proud to have attained another year of spectacular results by our DP graduates last year. Of particular note for the Class of 2024: 37 of the 38 students (97%) were enrolled in the full Diploma, in comparison with the global average of 63%. 37 of the 37 students (100%) enrolled in the full Diploma at KIST attained the IB Diploma, in comparison with the global average of 80%. The average score for KIST students attaining the IB Diploma was 41.5 points, 11.2 points above the IB Diploma global average of 30.3 points. 2 students (5%) attained a perfect score of 45 points. 31 students (82%) attained 40 points or above, for which 11% globally achieve. 21 KIST students attaining the IB DP (55%) attained scores of 42 points or above, qualifying them to be considered for the KIST “Learning for Life” University Support Scholarship. 54% of students attaining the IB Diploma enrolled at KIST prior to Grade 6. These statistics reflect well on the quality of learning in our elementary and secondary school programs. The chart below shows a breakdown of KIST averages and a comparison against the IB DP world average scores for each course. 100% of courses offered at KIST had results above the IB global averages. 96% of courses offered at KIST (with green and blue shading) had results more than 0.5 points above the IB global averages. 81% of courses offered at KIST (with blue shading) had results more than 1 point above the IB global averages. KIST is a Pearson Edexcel IGCSE school and all KIST students sit the IGCSE exams in Grade 10. IGCSE tests are graded on a scale of 1 to 9, with 9 being the maximum possible score. More information about the Edexcel IGCSE can be found by clicking here . IGCSE Exam Results June 2023.

More information about the ISA can be found by clicking here . The statistics for ISA performance at KIST for the 2021-22 school year are shown below. To measure student progress against international benchmarks, and to prepare students for the university application process, all KIST students in Grades 10 sit the College Board PSAT exam in October each year. As PSAT exams are scored on a common scale with the SAT exams, it is assumed that if students were to sit the SAT immediately after sitting the PSAT that their scores would be similar. The PSAT is a standardized assessment implemented by the College Board that measures proficiency in mathematics and evidence-based reading and writing. More information about the PSAT can be found by clicking here . Below is a comparison of 2024-25 KIST Grade 10 student performance against the grade-level benchmark scores published by the College Board. The College Board prepares benchmarks for college readiness for both Grade 10 and Grade 11. While KIST performance data below are for Grade 10 students, the benchmarks for Grade 11 are included in brackets for comparison purposes. Again this year, KIST students performed well above average, with none of our students falling below the overall College Board Benchmarks. We were particularly pleased that 82 % of our students performed above the 90th percentile on the PSAT exam. This data confirms that the introduction of various initiatives over the past years is having positive influence on teaching and learning in KIST classrooms. A graph of PSAT scores over the past ten years is below. ©2020 K.

Our answer is that KIST graduates gain acceptance to, and go on to attend, an impressive list of universities around the world. Below is a list of universities to which KIST students have gained acceptance (as of April 2019). Click here to view our School Profile . A note about scholarships: KIST aims to keep international education accessible and, as such, makes best efforts to keep tuition fees as low as possible. But accessibility to tertiary education as well is often limited for some students due to financial reasons. KIST students are supported and encouraged to attain their personal best so that scholarship support becomes a reality for them. Many KIST students have attained various levels of scholarship support from universities around the world (represented below by a black cap icon). It should be noted that for some countries, scholarship is rarely offered prior to entering the university, with such assistance becoming available based on performance attained after enrollment. = enrolled = scholarship offered with admission AUSTRALIA Australian National University Queensland University of Technology University of Queensland Deakin University Sydney Institute of TAFE University of Sydney Monash University University of Melbourne CANADA Acadia University Ryerson University University of Regina Algonquin College Sheridan College University of Toronto Bishop University Simon Fraser University University of Victoria Dalhousie University Trent University University of Waterloo McGill University University of British Columbia University of Western Ontario Mount Allison University University of Northern British Columbia York University JAPAN Akita International University Lakeland University Tokyo International University Chuo University Meiji Gakuin University Tokyo Future University Dokkyo University Nagoya University Tokyo Medical and Dental University (Medicine) Doshisha University Okayama University (Medicine) University of Tokyo Hosei University Osaka University Waseda University International Christian University Ritsumeikan University Yokohama City University (Medicine) Juntendo University (Medicine) Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University Yokohama National University Keio University Sophia University Kwansei Gakuin University Temple University Japan UNITED KINGDOM Ashton University Newcastle University University of Leicester Bangor University Oxford Brookes University University of Liverpool Birmingham City University Queen Mary, University of London University of Lincoln Brunel University Roehampton University University of Manchester Camberwell College of Art and Design Royal Holloway, University of London University of Nottingham City University London Staffordshire University University of Reading College of Fine Art and Design London St. Georges, University of London (Medicine) University of Saint Andrews Durham University University College London University of Sheffield Edinburgh Napier University University of Aberdeen University of Southampton European Business School London University of the Arts London University of Stirling Glasgow School of Art University of Bath University of Strathclyde Goldsmith's, University of London University of Birmingham University of Sussex HULT International Business School University of Bristol University of Surrey Imperial College London University of Cambridge University of Warwick King's College, London University of Cardiff University of West England, Bristol Kingston University University of Central Lancashire (Medicine) University of West London Lancaster University University of East Anglia University of Westminster Leeds College of Art University of Edinburgh University of York Leeds Metropolitan University University of Essex London School of Econ. & Pol.

More KIST Graduates Around the World English language support 日本語 KIST recognizes that all teachers are language teachers and that language must be taught across the curriculum, not only in designated language activities. It is also recognized that each student is an individual with an individual learning style and individual needs. With regards to English proficiency, teachers tailor classroom activities to allow students to develop to their full potential. In addition to such differentiation, English language support is provided to students identified in need for such assistance. Assessing for English language support Before starting classes at KIST, students are pre-assessed by an English language support instructor or a relevant classroom/subject teacher using a standardized English language assessment, which is divided into the areas of reading, writing, listening and speaking. The results of the assessment are used as the first indication of which level of support will be required from the classroom teacher and the instructor. While receiving English language support, student progress is assessed continuously through standardized reading level benchmarking, student work samples, participation in class discussions and observations. Progress related to English language support is reported in a supplementary report sent home with each semester report. English language support in the Elementary School In the Elementary School, English language support is provided from K1 through Grade 5 for non-native English-speaking students, with two main, overlapping purposes. First of all, for students whose level of English does not allow them to fully access our curriculum independently, English language support helps them to comprehend the material and concepts involved, and to express their understanding of this content. The second purpose of English language support is to facilitate the language development of English language learners. Depending on the language level of the students, and on the activity or lesson material at hand, language support may take one or more of the following forms: Push-in, pull-out, and/or differentiation of instruction A mix of two models of support, push-in and pull-out, is used to facilitate English language learners’ access to the curriculum and English language development. Pull-out is when one student, or a small group of students with similar needs, is taken out of the main lesson by the English language support instructor for a separate lesson. In contrast, the push-in model is when the instructor works within the main lesson together with the classroom teacher. In both cases, joint planning between the instructor and the class teacher ensures that the unit objectives are met for all students and that students’ language needs, individual learning style and other individual needs are all taken into consideration when differentiating instruction. To enable students the maximum opportunities to use language in meaningful contexts, particularly in their interactions with English-fluent peers, the push-in model is chosen most often. The instructor, therefore, usually provides differentiated scaffolding and adapted resources within the main classroom. However, there are times when a pull-out session is deemed the most effective way to achieve review of content or skills. A series of pull-out lessons may be established, however, pull-out sessions are often one-off lessons to consolidate understanding before returning to the next lesson in the main classroom. Language focused co-curricular activities and programs As part of the Co-curricular Activities Program across the school, a range of academic clubs and support classes are offered. In the Elementary School, Learning Enhancement Academic Program (LEAP) support class are offered before school each day for students in K3 through to Grade 5. These 30 minute-long lessons focus on various English language skills and those eligible to do so may attend between 2 to 5 times per week. Class sizes are limited, and the students with the highest English language needs are given priority. English language support in the Secondary School English language support is provided in the Secondary School to meet the needs of non-native English-speaking students or other students whose level of English does not allow them to fully access our curriculum independently. Depending on the English proficiency level of the student, language support may take one or more of the following forms: Differentiated instructional pathways (Grades 6 – 12) Two pathways for English are provided for students in Grades 6 through 8 and for students in Grades 11 and 12 as shown below. Grades Subject Description Grades 6 – 8 Language and Literature Designed for native or near-native English speaking students or those who do not require language support. It is a literature-based subject that requires full proficiency in reading, writing, listening and speaking skills. Language and Literature with Additional Intensive English Support Designed for students who need additional support accessing the curriculum in English. Students in the Additional IE Support classes participate in the mainstream Language and Literature course and have a modified timetable to allow for additional English classes each week to provide personalized support. Students can be recommended for exit from the Additional IE Support classes upon high achievement in summative assessments and successful taking of our internal English test. Grades 9 – 10 Language and Literature Designed for native or near-native English speaking students or those who do not require language support. It is a literature-based subject that requires full proficiency in reading, writing, listening and speaking skills. Grades 11 – 12 Language and Literature (Higher Level) A rigorous course designed for native or near-native speakers of English who enjoy reading literature. It assumes in-depth understanding and high level skills in reading, writing, listening and speaking. Language and Literature (Standard Level) Designed for native or near-native speakers of English who have developed a good understanding of and proficiency in the English language, but may need further focus in developing high level skills in some/all of reading, writing, listening and speaking. Note: Students in Grade 6 to Grade 8 with Additional Intensive English Support classes do not study arts due to increased scheduling of English classes. Students study all other courses together with mainstream MYP students. Students receiving Additional Intensive English Support are expected to graduate from such support by the end of Grade 8. For new enrollments, English language subject allocation is determined from the results of an assessment test conducted at the time of initial application to enroll at KIST. Students in Grades 6 through 8 identified as requiring language support will be placed in the Intensive English Class until they have developed the necessary skills to enter the Language and Literature course. By Grade 11, it is an expectation that students will undertake one of the Language and Literature courses. As in-class English language support is not provided to students in Grades 11 and 12, and due to the nature of the course of study, applicants seeking admission to these grades are likely to be unsuccessful if the results of their assessment test show that they would be unable to function independently in the classroom. In-class English language support (Grades 6 – 10) In-class English language support is provided for students in Grades 6 through 10 who have not yet reached a level of English language proficiency which facilitates success in the classroom. All students nominated by their subject teachers, and reviewed by the English Language Support Coordinator, receive in-class language support. In-class language support is offered through measures such as: assessment and task scaffolding, vocabulary assistance and extension, small group sessions, research and assessment assistance, and other forms deemed necessary. English language support instructors work collaboratively with the subject teachers and coordinators to provide the best possible support for the students. The progress of students receiving language support is tracked and monitored over the duration that they receive support. Out-of-class English language support (Grades 6 – 10) Students in the Secondary School are expected upon admission to have relatively strong English proficiency and thereby be able to function, with provided support if needed, in the classroom context. In special situations, out-of-class English language support ('pull-out' support) may be offered to support students in need. Such support may be provided outside of the regularly scheduled day (before/after school) or, upon consultation with the subject teacher, students may be pulled out of their respected subject time to work one-on-one with the English language support instructor to clarify or review content from the class. Language focused co-curricular activities and programs: Academic Writing Students in the Secondary School in need of additional support in academic writing are enrolled in additional lessons throughout the week. Academic writing classes are intended for students who are in English Language and Literature but still need to improve their writing. Also, students who are in the English Language Acquisition classes for Grades 9 and 10 take part in academic writing classes. These classes develop student understanding of different writing genres and support students in using correct writing forms appropriate to the demands of the writing context. Academic Writing classes are held in the mornings before first period throughout the week. 日本語 ©2020 K.

More KIST Graduates Around the World University guidance counseling 日本語 The IB Diploma Programme (DP) began at KIST in September 2004, with our inaugural Grade 12 class graduating in June 2006. Our students have high academic aspirations with dreams of attending universities around the world. Successful completion of the two-year DP opens up a wide range of possibilities for students in terms of university options. Achieving a high DP score opens even more doors to the world's leading universities. Many universities around the world recognize the DP as a challenging, rigorous program that prepares students for university study. In fact, for many universities, an IB Diploma is all students will need to gain entrance. It is, however, important to note that each university has its own individual requirements and we recommend that families investigate this early. To assist students and their families navigate the complexities of university entrance, our University Guidance Counselors provide advice to students in the Secondary School regarding the university application process. Specifically, the counselors: Provide advice on universities and colleges around the world Prepare official transcripts Coordinate the preparation of teacher recommendations and other documents needed for the application process Coordinate presentations by visiting university representatives Arrange visits to local universities and colleges Provide information on forthcoming university fairs and events Provide advice on vocational options. The counselors speak with students on university matters individually and through specific sessions held at particular times during the year as part of the Advisory curriculum. They are also available for individual consultations with families by appointment. Click here to view a list of universities to which KIST graduates have received acceptances. 日本語 ©2020 K.

More KIST Graduates Around the World Student welfare counseling 日本語 At KIST, we believe that students are better prepared for learning when they are physically, emotionally and intellectually healthy, safe and happy. Student welfare and well-being are the responsibility of all staff. Our teachers and administrative staff have an important role as a source of support. The connections and relationships that teachers and students develop can mean that teachers are the first contact for many concerns and developmental issues. Student support is a whole school priority; student learning is inextricably linked to student welfare. We aim to provide a foundation for student welfare and wellbeing through clearly articulated policies, protocols and practices. KIST prepares a team approach to supporting student welfare with teacher efforts guided by a Student Care Coordinator appointed to each of the Elementary and Secondary school areas. The Student Care Coordinator has experience with providing appropriate student welfare support and with initiatives aimed at supporting healthy social and emotional development. We have a strong emphasis on preventive approaches and early intervention activities aimed at addressing student needs which we view as part of childhood and adolescent development within the normal range of school community interactions. We aim to provide a safe and comfortable environment where students feel comfortable talking about developmental issues with our school nurse/doctor, with teachers/staff or with the Student Care Coordinator. When meeting with students, while we aim to maintain confidentiality of the information discussed as much as possible, our polices and practices reflect our responsibility to parents and to keeping them information of situations of concern. We have policy in place to protect the physical and emotional well-being of students. When student and/or family needs are beyond that which can be provided by the school, we provide access to community organizations, public and private, to arrange for additional support. We do not provide psychological assessment or diagnostic services on campus; however, we do provide support to families in accessing alternate professional support services when needed. 日本語 ©2020 K.

More KIST Graduates Around the World Parental involvement 日本語 KIST was founded upon the belief that education is a collaborative effort between a school and a child’s family. We believe that a good school is defined not only by excellence in academic areas, but also through a warm, caring environment, strong social relationships and a solid relationship between the school and students’ homes. Part of this relationship is built through parents supporting at home the learning that takes place in the classroom, and part of it is built through the commitment by parents to the areas of the school that support our educational programs. We believe that parents/guardians who are actively involved in their children’s education and in the activities of the school act as excellent role models for their children and helps them build connections with the Action component in the PYP; Community and Service in the MYP; and Community, Action, Service in the DP. KIST relies heavily on parental support. There is a strong expectation that parents will be involved in their children’s education across all levels. As children move up through the school, it is often the case that parents spend less and less time focusing on their children’s school life for various reasons. As children get older, we assume that they have developed sufficient knowledge and skills that enable them to function more independently. This may be so to some extent. We believe, however, that continued parental involvement is vital for children as they move into adolescence after entering the secondary school. In addition, because of the academic demands of the Diploma Programme in Grade 11 and 12, parental support is especially important. Parents are encouraged to take part in their children’s school life by: Ensuring that children have the correct books and equipment each day. Showing interest by asking questions at the end of the day to find out what the children did at school. Encouraging discussion at home. Monitoring homework and study habits. Ensuring that children have access to a suitable study environment at home (including the provision of a computer with Internet and e-mail access as well as a printer). Setting time limits for watching television, playing computer games, chatting on line with friends etc. Regularly checking for messages from teachers and notes from the school. Attending school information and curriculum explanation evenings. Participating in school excursions. Reading the school newsletter. Communicating regularly with teachers and asking questions. Completing duty days as part of the School Support Program. Volunteering for additional duties at school. Taking an active role in Friends of KIST through attendance at meetings and participation in events. Attending, assisting and organizing school events including the annual School Festival. Attending Parent/Teacher/Student Interviews to check children’s progress. Attending Student Led Conferences that are part of each student’s assessment cycle. Becoming a class parent organizer to assist teachers facilitate class events etc. Ensuring that children have a goal for the future and know what they must do in order to achieve that goal. We appreciate the fact that many parents/guardians have their own work and personal commitments. We look forward, however, to the continued support of all families across all levels of the school community in helping us to help your children. 日本語 ©2020 K.

More KIST Graduates Around the World Giving to KIST 日本語 Tax deductible donations KIST welcomes donations from both individuals and corporations from the school and wider communities. Donations are used to improve and expand the quality of our facilities and services in order to enrich the educational experiences of our students. Specifically, donations help us to: Expand and improve the physical school environment. Purchase equipment and resources for the classroom. KIST was accredited as a \"tokutei koeki zoshin hojin\" (a \"charitable organization for the purpose of continued public benefit\") by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government on September 26, 2014. According to tax law, an amount of money given to the school specifically as a donation can be deducted from an individual or corporation's annual income; however, donations made at the time of first enrollment before the first day of school are not recognized under this policy. After receiving a donation, the school will issue a receipt as well as a copy of our certificate of recognition as a charitable organization. To claim the deduction, these documents must be submitted to your local tax office when you lodge your annual income tax return. Please note that money donated can only be allocated for pre-determined purposes such as the expansion of educational facilities or the construction of new school buildings, or for specific purchases such as machines, equipment, textbooks and teaching materials that are recognized as being for the purpose of continued public benefit. Deductible donations made by individuals For individuals donating to a charitable organization, donated amounts may be accepted as tax deductions. The amount allowable may be considered as 1) an income reduction calculated by deducting 2,000 yen from the total amount of annual donations and deducting the amount remaining from the individual's total annual income, or 2) as a tax reduction calculated by deducting 2,000 yen from the total amount of annual donations and deducting 40% of the amount remaining from the individual's annual tax payment. For either method, the amount allowable is limited to 40% of the total annual income, provided that a tax return is submitted for that year. Please consult your tax agent or local tax office for more information. For resident's tax (both prefectural and municipal), the amount of deductible donations allowable is calculated differently from that of income tax. This calculation depends on your place of residence as of January 1 in the year after the donation was made and differs from area to area. Please consult your prefectural or city/town office for details. Deductible donations made by a corporation The maximum amount of deductible donations a corporation may make to a non-charitable organization is normally calculated as follows: ([Corporation's capital x 0.375%] plus [Corporation's annual pre-tax income x 6.25%]) divided by 2 = Allowable amount In the case of a charitable organization, however, the deductible amount is calculated as follows: ([Corporation's capital x 0.25%] plus [Corporation's annual pre-tax income x 2.5%]) divided by 4 = Allowable amount Please refer to the Corporate Tax Law and the Corporate Tax Enforcement Order or consult your tax agent, accountant or local tax office for more information. How to make a donation To make a donation to KIST, please submit the Donation Form to the school office. At the same time, please deposit your donation into the following bank account: Bank name: Mizuho Bank (Bank number: 0001) Branch name: Honjo Branch (Branch number: 050) Account type: Regular savings Account number: 2039806 Account name: Gakkouhoujin K International School Kensetsukifukinguchi For more information regarding donations and tax law, please contact us .

More KIST Graduates Around the World Admissions policy 日本語 The information on this page has been extracted from the KIST Admissions Handbook . Please read the complete handbook for more detailed information on admissions policies. Admissions KIST welcomes academically motivated and well-behaved students from internationally minded families who can demonstrate a commitment to our guiding statements and educational programs. Applications for admission to KIST are considered for all children regardless of race, national or ethnic origin, religion, gender or socio-economic background. As KIST does not employ a learning needs specialist, we are unable to accept applications for students with special learning needs. Applications from children with physical disabilities are considered on a case-by-case basis according to the specific needs and whether or not the school environment can cater for such needs. As part of our commitment to maintaining a truly international student body, applications are accepted from students from all cultural backgrounds. In order to promote diversity, we strive to maintain a balance of cultural backgrounds at each grade level as well as in individual classes. We seek to ensure that the balance of cultural backgrounds and language groups is diverse while at the same time does not compromise the position of English as the language of instruction. Gender balance is also a consideration in all classes. As a selective school, KIST has developed a comprehensive application and admissions process that enables us to evaluate all applicants in order to determine their readiness for learning within our rigorous academic environment and to identify those most likely to benefit from the programs we offer. At each stage through this process, we look for evidence that applicants have developed, or are expected to be able to develop, appropriate learning habits and personal traits that will lead them to academic success. Age eligibility and application restrictions Due to the mid-August start to the school year, the cut-off date for enrollment age at KIST is July 31 .

For K2 and K3, applications outside the cut-off dates will only be considered in exceptional circumstances where specific reasons have been identified. In such cases, placement decisions are based on observations, previous educational experiences and other considerations. All children must have completed toilet training before joining the school. In certain cases for Grades 1 through 10, we may consider requests for enrollment for up to a maximum of one grade level above or below an applicant's eligible grade depending on their current grade of enrollment, previous school records, years of schooling, and the level of academic performance. In such cases, the specific reason for the request must be stated in your application and documentary evidence must be attached where appropriate. Applications for Grade 11 and 12 may be considered for children up to a maximum of one year below or a maximum of two years above the eligible age. Although the decision for an application outside the eligible grade is made after careful consideration of the specific reasons through discussions with parents/guardians, it may not be possible to grant the request if we believe that it would be detrimental to the child's learning development or inappropriate for our teachers or the needs of other students in the class. Special restrictions for applications to Grades 10 to 12 Due to the nature of the course of study, there are certain restrictions for applications for admission to Grades 10 to 12. Please check the KIST Admissions Handbook for full details. Admission requirements and expectations In order to provide an environment conducive to learning, there are various expectations that must be met by applicants in order to gain admission. Academic expectations As an academically focused school, applicants - with the exception of applicants for K1 - must demonstrate that they are highly motivated learners, particularly those applying for Grades 2 and above, who achieve high scores in their academic subjects, particularly in English and mathematics, and this must be evident in the application documentation. Due to the academically challenging curriculum in the Diploma Programme (DP), which includes university level content, there are high academic expectations for students moving from Grade 10 to the DP in Grade 11. Families for whom Tokyo is their permanent or long-term residence and who are interested in applying to KIST in Grade 11 are strongly encouraged, therefore, to instead consider applying for admission from an earlier grade in order to provide students with a longer period of time to develop the knowledge and skills needed to progress to the DP in Grade 11. Behavior expectations KIST strives to create an environment where students from various social and cultural backgrounds can learn together in a safe environment free from prejudice, and where the actions of individuals do not interfere negatively with the learning of others. Expectations for student conduct are based on three behavior standards: Respect , Responsibility and Safety . Applicants are expected to demonstrate exemplary behavior, appropriate attitudes to learning, good organizational skills, focus and concentration in class, and be able to interact appropriately with others. Furthermore, students applying for the upper-Secondary School should be well-spoken, articulate individuals with clear ideas on why they want to study at KIST and how this will affect their future. Language requirements The student population at KIST represents a wide range of different cultural backgrounds. This means that our students also speak a variety of different languages. To enable all students to learn together through one language medium, we have adopted English as our language of instruction. With the exception of applicants wishing to enter K1 from the start of the school year in August, students must have reached a certain level in English already in order to enter the school. Applicants for the Secondary School, in particular, must be able to demonstrate a high level of English ability in order to cope with the demands of studying specialized subjects in English. Because of this, due to the nature of the course of study, applicants seeking admission to Grades 8 and above who are identified as requiring language support are not accepted. Application screening As we receive many applications each year for limited places, it is not possible for every child to be admitted. In order to determine the suitability of applicants for our school, all applications are screened. Not all applicants will pass the screening stage. Those who are unsuccessful will be unable to proceed to the testing stage. Please note that we are unable to respond to individual inquiries regarding screening results. 日本語 ©2020 K.

More KIST Graduates Around the World East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami Support 日本語 KIST Helping Out in Tohoku on April 15th & 16th (updated April 22, 2011) Another trip to the Tohoku area on Saturday, April 16, was planned as a part of KIST’s East-Japan Earthquake Appeal. To prepare for it, students, parents, teachers and staff spent time the day before preparing food, cooking, sorting supplies and packing donations. As before, volunteers will be serving approximately 2500 hot meals. Thank you everyone for your support! A big thank you to KIST families for your many donations. Thank you also to the K1 students  for baking scones and cookies, grade 2 classes for collecting school supplies, to the KIST teachers who raised money through the Yamathon, to Coca Cola for their financial donation to our efforts and especially to the students who have made donations on their own because they are caring and want to help others. See photo gallery On Friday the 15th of April, a two ton truck and a KIST school bus packed full of equipment, food, and donations, left the school grounds at 10:30pm for the journey to the evacuation sites. We arrived at the first site, the Tagajou city sports center in Tagajou city, Miyagi prefecture on Saturday the 16th at 7:30am. Here we were able to serve around 1500 lunches to evacuees and neighboring community members. Our next stop was at the Shichigahama central community center and the third at the International village in Shichigahama; we were able to serve around a 1000 dinner meals at these two locations. Due to the requests of the locals our menu received a little change; we served the vegetable and meat chanko prepared by the Kitanoumi-beya sumo wrestlers, udon, bulgogi (Korean grilled beef), simmered meat and potatoes, Salmon flakes, shirasuhoshi, tsukudani, three varieties of pickles, and for dessert, oranges, bananas, tangerines, donuts and dorayaki. The food situation at the locations hadn’t improved a great deal since our first visit two weeks after the earthquake. The locals were delighted to receive the meals, telling us that it felt like it was their birthday, and that they didn’t expect to eat such nice food since the quake. The second location at the Shichigahama central community center was located on a hill, looking down we could see the town which had suffered severe damage with houses being swept away in the tsunami, so during our break time we decided to have a walk around. That area was just a few kilometers from the ocean so all the houses had been swept away and reduced to piles of rubble. Amongst the rubble were high school graduation albums, children’s clothing, toys, and dog kennels, and this left us picturing the people who had been going about their normal lives just before the earthquake hit. We would like to thank the whole KIST community for your donations, your assistance with the preparations, also to those who have been planning for this event, and finally to those who helped with the early morning cleanup on the Sunday morning. Thanks to the assistance of students, parents and school staff we were able to make this appeal a success. However, it is vital that we continue our support for the victims of the quakes. Therefore, we are planning another visit on Saturday 30th April. We will be sending out more information in a separate notice in due course and we thank you for your continued cooperation and support. See photo gallery KIST Helping Out in Tohoku (updated March 30, 2011 2:20am) Dear KIST Community, At 1:00 am Friday morning, 24 KIST staff began their journey to Tagajou city in the Miyagi Prefecture.  A KIST school bus and a truck full of equipment, food, donation supplies and fuel headed to two elementary schools serving as evacuation sites as part of the KIST's Tohoku Earthquake Appeal. The school bus and truck received authorization as emergency aid vehicles; the preparation for departure involved making sure we were completely self-sufficient and could carry enough fuel for the return trip. I am happy to report that we all made it back to KIST on Saturday morning at 6:00 am. We traveled 7 hours to reach the first school, Tagajou Elementary School. Requested donations were provided to the shelter, hot meals served to evacuees and neighboring community members and donations of snacks, diapers, clothing and other items were made available to the residents who needed them.  The hot meals consisted of grilled fish, rice, Korean 'Purukogi', curry, udon as well as tea and fruit.  There were lots of smiles to go around as residents were happy to have a hot meal two weeks after the quake. See photo gallery Our next stop was Jounan Elementary school where we repeated the process of serving hot meals of yaki niku, grilled fish, rice, udon, fruit and snacks. We were getting the setting up and packing up process down to a routine. With the help of JCI for letting us know of a school who really could use a hot meal, Mr. and Mrs. Komaki were able to arrange for us to visit a third site, Tenshin Elementary School.  We were able to set up and serve meals to the 950 evacuees living at that school very quickly.  The remaining supplies which were brought were donated to the school and to JCI as with the other donations the school has been collecting. The residents we visited sincerely appreciated the organization, planning, collection, purchasing, volunteering, serving and chatting. One group of girls came up to me at our first school and were very excited to hear what we were going to do.  They told us they were hungry as they were only given one donut and a sausage for breakfast so they very happy to hear they would be given a hot and delicious lunch.  Thank you everyone for your support from those who have been planning for this event in the office for weeks to those who made a donation, it all made, and is, making a difference.
